We will attempt §Rreduce§! §YTaft's§! influence on the party and §Gincrease§! our own! §YTaft§! will not go down without a fight, however. We will have to deal with a series of attempts by §YTaft§! to wrestle control over the §YRepublican Party§! in the form of events and missions."
USA_reconcile_progressives_strategy:0 "Taft's strategy will be to §Greconcile§! with §Yprogressives§! in the party, giving them government jobs and concessions on policy. This will make them more supportive of us, and could prevent the party from fracturing. However, it cost a lot of political power and may be §9too little too late§!, only serving to strengthen the influence of any potential §tprimary challengers§!"
USA_fuck_roosevelt:0 "Taft's strategy will be to §Rreduce§! the influence of §Yprogressives§! in the party, giving government positions to §Yconservatives§! and attempting to §tdiscredit§! Roosevelt. This will most likely enrage Roosevelt and other progressives, however if their influence is low enough we will surely survive any primary attempt, and they won't have the political clout to break off from the party. However, it may only §9embolden§! Roosevelt and only serve to make Taft look §tout of touch§!"

  USA_united_states_bureau_of_mines:0 "Create the Bureau of Mines" 
 USA_united_states_bureau_of_mines_desc:0 "There has been a concerningly high rise in catastrophic mine accidents lately. These accidents are not only killing hundreds monthly, but are also leading to wide spread protests, as well as slowing industries and markets that rely on these mined goods. The newly created Bureau of Mines should hopefully be able to introduce effective regulations to increase the saftey of our miners." 
 USA_mann_elkins_act:0 "Fight Railway Monopolies" 
 USA_mann_elkins_act_desc:0 "There is a concerning amount of unfair trading practices and a lack of competition in the railway industry. While we have made progress with the previously passed Hepburn Act that allowed us to set maximum railraod rates, we could nip the bud on this issue completly by just suspending railroad rate increases all together. This bill. inreasing the Interstate Commerce Commissions power, will allow us to do just that."
USA_continue_FDA_reforms:0 "Strengthen FDA Regulations"
USA_continue_FDA_reforms_desc:0 "Food in the 19th century was often filled with unsafe preservatives and dangerous fillings used to cheaply increase the volume of foods, like saw dust and shell chippings.

USA_continue_teddies_nature_preserves:0 "Protect the Environment"
USA_continue_teddies_nature_preserves_desc:0 "Teddy Roosevelt has gone great lengths to protect our envionrnment from deterioration. With the Pickett act, we can continue these efforts by designating public lands as reserves and withdraw them from settlement, sale, or entry for various purposes. We can use this law to protect several different environmental beauties from destruction."
USA_general_withdraw_act:0 "Abuse the power of the Pickett law"
USA_general_withdraw_act_desc:0 "The Pickett law, in theory, should be a great win for enviornmentalists. However there is a fatal flaw in the legislation that many have noticed; we could order a "reserve" for conservation but with the hidden intent of later allowing oil drilling or resource extraction after the public is cleared from the land."
USA_political_strategy:0 "Riding a Razor Wire"
USA_political_strategy_desc:0 "President Taft has a... tough time ahead, to say the least. With both increasing Roosevelt anger at our administration and the panic of 1910 decreasing faith in our policies, a brewing storm is gathering that could see the end of Taft's political career entirely if we are not careful."

USA_reconcile_with_progressives:0 "Crack the Door Open"
USA_reconcile_with_progressives_desc:0 "While Taft and Roosevelt have had their personal differences, the truth is on policy they do indeed share many similarities. Scandals like the Pinchot Ballinger controversy have definitely worsened our reputation amongst progressives. However, it is possible that with some new campaign strategies and some concessions to progressives in the administration, we should surely be able to win 'em back."
USA_shut_the_door_in_their_faces:0 "Slam the Door in Their Faces"
USA_shut_the_door_in_their_faces_desc:0 "That bastard Roosevelt and his goons are most likely going to attempt to primary president Taft, or split off from the republicans all together, no matter what we do. The truth is Roosevelt seems to hold a very personal grudge against us and we shouldn't waste political capital or influence trying to appease him. After all, no man has ever tamed a tiger into a kitten by stroking it."
USA_new_car_regulations:0 "New Car Regulations"
USA_new_car_regulations_desc:0 "Sorry bro, but the USA dev couldn't find any information on what these new car regulations actually were, just that they existed. However, it feels wrong to leave this focus with no description at all. Hope you're having fun though!"
USA_white_slave_traffic_act:0 "White Slave Traffic Act"

USA_crumpacker_act_desc:0 "There are 92,000,000 Americans, yet only 391 seats in the House of Representatives. How on earth is each representative supposed to adequately represent 235,000 Americans? An expansion of the House is long overdue at this point, and the Appointment Act will fix this."
USA_Ford_Motor_contracts:0 "Support Ford Motor"
USA_Ford_Motor_contracts_desc:0 "Ford Motor is the largest car manufacturing company in the United States. With cars increasingly becoming more and more accessible, helping Ford Motor expand could generate a lot of consumer spending and help our industry grow, making it a great investment."
USA_direct_election_of_senators:0 "Propose the 17th Ammendment"
USA_direct_election_of_senators_desc:0 "The way senators are currently "elected" is with state legislators appointing them. While not inheritely anti-democratic, it still does open possibilites to corruption and unpopular senators. A growing ammount of progressives, and even moderate, have called for directly electing senators, like with the House of Representatives."
USA_united_states_childrens_bureau:0 "Legal, but Safe Child Labour"
USA_united_states_childrens_bureau_desc:0 "There is sadly a large amount of child poverty and exploitation, a department to help fight both of these has failed in congress multiple times, but with pressure mounting we could most likely finally see the United States Children Bureau become reality."

USA_request_teddies_help_in_the_midterms_desc:0 "We've made our intentions to reconcile with progressives clear, and now its time for Teddy to do his part. With Teddy still very popular nation wide, his support in the midterms would be critical to keeping Republicans afloat."

USA_give_conservatives_government_positions:0 "Give Conservatives Government Positions"
USA_give_conservatives_government_positions_desc:0 "A simple way to reduce the influence progressives have on the party is to simply reduce their influence over policy. Replacing progressives with conservatives in the administration will help strengthen the conservative wing of the Republicans."
USA_secure_big_donors:0 "Secure Big Donors"
USA_secure_big_donors_desc:0 "Progressive policies naturally hurt big business and their interests. With us not having to worry about progressives' opinions anymore, we can show big business our more conservative views and secure their support against a progressive challenger."
USA_fight_progressive_influence:0 "Secure the Establishment"
USA_fight_progressive_influence_desc:0 "Not all top Republicans agree with our administration, but that doesn't mean they support destroying the Republican party.

USA_united_states_postal_service:0 "Postal Banking"
USA_united_states_postal_service_desc:0 "The postal banking service will accept deposits from the general public, but not offer full banking services. Instead, it will redeposit the funds to designated banks.

USA_set_toll_rates_on_panama_canal_shipping_desc:0 "With the Panama Canal nearing completion, we must prepare to set toll rates for those who wish to use the Panama Canal. We could set them high, which would increase our overall profits, but could be too much for other countries to accept which would result in less total revenue. We could also set them low, which would yield us less profit but guarentee the canal is used by the international community. Of course we could instead do an inbetween decision instead."

ww1_USA.19.d:0 "The electable presidents avaible (there are some non elected ones too) are the following, starting off in 1912; Taft (second term), Teddy Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, William Jennings Bryan, and Champ Clark. \n To stop Roosevelt from running as taft, you must have Progressive Republicans loyalty above 75 in the "Taft's Republican Party" decision UI, which then gives him a chance at winning the 1912 election. The easiest way to get Roosevelt elected is to alienate conservative Republicans as much as possible as Taft (while making sure not to get progressive support above 75). This will cause conservatives to defect to the Democratic party, leading to Clark being nominated by the democrats for president, who Roosevelt will easily beat. Electing Wilson is quite simple, chose to play as the democrats in the "1912 campaign season begins" event then simply select Wilson to win the nomination and election. Clark is also the same, simply select the Democrats then select him to win. To gain Bryan, pick the option to have the Democratic convention be deadlocked, Bryan will be nominated as a compromise canidate. \nThe following Presidents are aviable for 1916; Wilson (second term only), Robert La Follette (only aviable if Teddy won 1912), William Jennings Bryan (second term or if the U.S is in ww1 only), Champ Clark (second term only), Thomas R. Marshall (against La Follette only), and Eugene V. Debs (electable under Clark only) \n how to get the 1916 presidents; for Wilson, La Follette, Bryan (second term only), and Marshall, simply chose to win the election in the event. Non second term Bryan will win if you have more then 500k casualties while Debs requires you to have over 30% socialist support, "mass exploitation of workers" or worse as the current workers rights national spirit level, "a perfectly broken system" national spirit, and "empowered monopolies" national spirit \nCivil War; the debs presidency can end in 3 ways; good debs ending, impeachment, and being couped. You can be impeached by rushing down to "The Great Gambit" focus as fast as possible without doing any focus's involving increasing support in congress, while also passing civil rights legislation. You need to make sure relations with congress are as terrible as possible and then when the "Trust Elimination Act" (proposed by "The Great Gambit" focus ) fails chose to try and push it through executive action. You'll then be impeached Leading to your running mate Stedman will take over and will attempt to form a Marxist state. He will get couped no matter what you do and you can chose to have it be successful or fail based on who you want to play as (there will be a civil war either way).
