Saafet chose to adopt a Slavic name, Ruska. The next day, her father, a hodzha, protested to the mayor along with other Muslims. They claimed their daughter had been abducted and was still underage (almost 16 years old) for marriage. On February 27, 1910, the court revoked the marriage permission and ordered Saafet to return to her parents. She went back to their house until the evening. That night, a crowd of “adventurers” gathered outside Saafet’s house intending to “rescue” her. The authorities moved her to a police station but couldn’t manage the approximately 1000 people, and Saafet eventually married Yordan on the 28th. Their wedding was celebrated by many in the central square, as it was the first Sunday before Lent, and a traditional fancy-dress carnival was held. The local police officer, who also attended the carnival, was mocked for failing to keep Saafet in the police station. Half an hour later, he called for cavalry support, and after some mutual verbal insults, a fight broke out between the citizens and the military.
