#A meeting in Ireland
ww1_easter_uprising.1.t: "A Meeting in Ireland"
 ww1_easter_uprising.1.d: "The Supreme Council of the IRB met just over a month after the British government have declared war on Germany. At this meeting, they elected to stage an uprising before the war ended and to secure help from Germany. Responsibility for the planning of the rising was given to Tom Clarke and Seán Mac Diarmada. Patrick Pearse, Michael Joseph O'Rahilly, Joseph Plunkett, and Bulmer Hobson.\n\nThis uprising could very well end a farce, simply leaving good men martyrs, or it could be the start of an Irish state."
 ww1_easter_uprising.1.a: "I didn't see this one coming..."
#The Easter Uprising Fails
ww1_easter_uprising.2.t: "The Easter Uprising"
 ww1_easter_uprising.2.d: "The streets of Dublin erupted in rebellion. Irish nationalists, led by figures such as Patrick Pearse and James Connolly, seized key locations and declared an independent Irish Republic. Our forces have swiftly responded, deploying armed men to quash the uprising. After several days of arresting rebels in the countryside, the uprising has been defeated. Dublin, and Ireland, are once again under British control, but the seeds of unrest in Ireland remain."
 ww1_easter_uprising.2.a: "The audacity!"
#The Easter Uprising Wins

#Ireland asks Germany for aid
ww1_easter_uprising.4.t: "A Call from the Emerald Isle"
 ww1_easter_uprising.4.d: "Our government has been approached by Irish plotters who seek to spark a rebellion against the British occupation in Ireland. We've been petitioned to provide material support for the rebels - weapons to fight off the Brits. This opportunity could take off some British divisions from our fronts, or even expand our influence across the channel after the war's end should we support the Irish greatly. However, it's a costly endeavor that isn't guaranteed to work, many within our administration would rather keep the guns for our own battles."
  ww1_easter_uprising.4.a: "We'll support the Irish, with Caution that is"
  ww1_easter_uprising.4.b: "A rebellion in Ireland could secure us victory!"
  ww1_easter_uprising.4.c: "Our materials are better suited to equip our own troops"
#German Shipments found in Ireland
ww1_easter_uprising.5.t: "German Arms Shipment Seized in Ireland"
 ww1_easter_uprising.5.d: "After an increase in British patrols of the coast of Ireland and higher checks at the ports, caches of German guns were found being transported off a transport ship. Whether the full cache was discovered is unknown but we've at least prevented some guns from getting in the hands of Irish forces. This discovery has aroused the suspicions of the armed forces who are now far more vigilant."
 ww1_easter_uprising.5.a: "Whatever would they be sending guns for?"
#Germany Supports Irish Rebels
ww1_easter_uprising.6.t: "The Extent of Our Help"
 ww1_easter_uprising.6.d: "Ireland must receive more German support, it's critical that we divert British attention away from the front. Shipments to Germany are ready to be made immediately, and our Irish contacts are eager for more guns to spread English blood. We must decide on the quantity of firearms we shall supply to Ireland. However, the more guns we supply in one go, while cheaper, the more chance Britain will have to intercept them."
 ww1_easter_uprising.6.a: "Our pockets are deep and plentiful"
 ww1_easter_uprising.6.b: "Why risk the British finding out?"
 ww1_easter_uprising.6.c: "On second thoughts..."
#German Shipments found in Ireland... again
ww1_easter_uprising.7.t: "Weapon Shipments to Ireland Intercepted"
 ww1_easter_uprising.7.d: "German weapon shipments to Ireland have been intercepted by Royal Navy ships, who performed a random stop and search aboard a disguised transport ship. The guns were found, the vessel impounded at the port of Dover, and the captain was put under arrest. The Captain has refused to yield the intended destination but British intelligence presumes the guns were meant for Irish weapons - before they luckily intercepted them."
ww1_easter_uprising.7.a: "Great..."
#IRB Set up Military Council
ww1_easter_uprising.8.t: "The Irish Military Council"
 ww1_easter_uprising.8.d: "Members of the IRB have established a secret military council in order to organize the uprising. Our intelligence in Ireland are unaware of the exact workings or plans, or much at all, simply its existence. From what we can tell the council operates separately from the ISB organization of which many members aren't convinced an armed rising against our troops would be opportune to the Irish."
 ww1_easter_uprising.8.a: "What do they think they're up to now?"

 ww1_easter_uprising_cat_desc: "With the opportunity of war, the §GIrish§! have begun to plot against the status quo. If the war continues it's all but guaranteed that there will be an uprising of some kind in §GIreland§! against §QBritish§! rule.

Should total readiness reach too high the §GIrish§! may preemptively rise up..."
