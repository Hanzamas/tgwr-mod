We will have to deal with a series of attempts by §YTaft§! to wrestle control over the §YRepublican Party§! in the form of events and missions."
USA_reconcile_progressives_strategy:0 "Taft's strategy will be to §Greconcile§! with §Yprogressives§! in the party, giving them government jobs and concessions on policy. This will make them more supportive of us, and could prevent the party from fracturing. However, it cost a lot of political power and may be §9too little too late§!, only serving to strengthen the influence of any potential §tprimary challengers§!"
USA_fuck_roosevelt:0 "Taft's strategy will be to §Rreduce§! the influence of §Yprogressives§! in the party, giving government positions to §Yconservatives§! and attempting to §tdiscredit§! Roosevelt. This will most likely enrage Roosevelt and other progressives, however if their influence is low enough we will surely survive any primary attempt, and they won't have the political clout to break off from the party. However, it may only §9embolden§! Roosevelt and only serve to make Taft look §tout of touch§!"
