#Agadir aftermath
ww1_germanrework.1.t:0 "Germany's Disgrace"
 ww1_germanrework.1.d:0 "Despite the grandiose posturing and saber-rattling, the end result of the Agadir crisis has been a diplomatic embarrassment. The crisis not only revealed Germany's weak position in the global arena but also severely damaged its prestige. The failure to secure any significant gains from the showdown with France has led to widespread criticism from both within the government and the general public. The Treaty of Fez, which concluded the crisis, saw Germany receive meager concessions in the Congo while France consolidated its hold over Morocco, a clear indicator of German diplomatic failure.\n\nThe public and political backlash has been particularly harsh on Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg, whose handling of the situation is seen as weak and indecisive. Many view his leadership as responsible for the national humiliation, arguing that a stronger stance or better negotiation tactics could have yielded more favorable outcomes. The Chancellor's popularity has plummeted, and there is a growing call for his dismissal as a means to restore confidence in the government's ability to uphold German interests and prestige on the world stage. The question now facing the Kaiser is whether to replace Hollweg in hopes of revitalizing the leadership or to endure the current political turmoil with the same leadership."

 ww1_germanrework.1.b:0 "The Kaiser pressures Hollweg to resign"
ww1_germanrework.2.t:0 "The Kaiser Appoints von Heydbrand"
 ww1_germanrework.2.d:0 "In a bold and decisive move, Kaiser Wilhelm II has appointed Ernst von Heydbrand und der Lasa as the new Chancellor of the German Empire. A figure renowned for his staunch conservatism and unwavering dedication to the Prussian ideals, von Heydbrand's ascent marks a significant shift in the political landscape of the empire.\n\nBorn into an aristocratic family, Ernst von Heydbrand has long been a prominent voice in the German Conservative Party. His career has been characterized by a fervent advocacy for the preservation of traditional German values and institutions. A fierce opponent of liberalism and socialism, von Heydbrand has consistently championed policies that strengthen the monarchy, the military, and the agrarian interests that form the backbone of his support.\n\nVon Heydbrand's tenure is expected to usher in an era of intensified conservative governance. With a reputation for his iron will and unyielding principles, he is anticipated to reinforce the Kaiser's vision of a strong, unified Germany, poised to assert its influence on the European stage. However, his appointment is not without controversy, as it risks deepening the divides within the Reichstag and among the populace, who are increasingly restless with the status quo."
 ww1_germanrework.2.a:0 "Good luck to the new chancellor"
ww1_germanrework.19.t:0 "Factions in the Right"
 ww1_germanrework.19.d:0 "The new chancellor is no staunch negotiator like von Hollweg was and will now have to manage the right-wing in his favor if he wishes to stay in power. The traditionalist conservatives and the pan-German nationalists see this as an opportunity to assert their influence over the right-wing factions that the new Chancellor relies on to stay in power. These nationalistic groups, driven by a desire to restore German prestige after the crisis and assert a more aggressive national policy, are vying for control and seeking to push their agendas within the Reichstag.\n\nAmidst this internal power struggle, the Chancellor faces another critical challenge':' the looming threat of the Social Democratic Party in the upcoming 1912 election. The SPD's growing popularity poses a significant risk to the current administration's stability and conservative values. To maintain power and prevent a potential shift in political dominance, the Chancellor must navigate the complex dynamics of right-wing politics, appeasing influential factions while also formulating strategies to curtail the SPD's appeal to the masses. The next few months will be pivotal in determining the future direction of Germany, as the new Chancellor strives to consolidate power and guide the nation through these turbulent times."

#1910 Strikes
ww1_germanrework.3.t:0 "Strikes in Hamburg"
 ww1_germanrework.3.d:0 "Earlier this morning a strike was called in the shipbuilding yards at Hamburg, our principal commercial seaport, current reports estimate that around ten thousand employees have ceased their work. The strike was supported by (and catalysed) by the Deutscher Transportarbeiter-Verband who have been a consistent thorn in the Kaiser's side since their formation earlier this year; highlighting to many within and outside the empire that the rise of socialism in Germany is a real threat to the Kaiser's power.\n\nThe ringleaders of the strike have threatened to continue the strike until their demands of higher wages and shorter hours have been met. Although the demands have been to little avail as the employers are persistent in denying the strikers out of fear of enabling further industrial action. Only time will tell whether the strikers' demands will be met but either way, Germany is sure to suffer more strikes as a consequence soon."

ww1_germanrework.4.t:0 "Clashes with Strikers in Berlin"
 ww1_germanrework.4.d:0 "In the heart of Berlin's industry, the district of Moabit has erupted into chaos. Due to the coal industry's lethal competitiveness, the workers at Kupfer and Co. (recently brought by the most ruthless capitalist in the country - Hugo Stinnes) who have received the short end of this competitiveness through diminishing wages and poor working conditions, have begun a major strike with tens of thousands of workers absent from the coal pits. Initially peaceful, the demonstration mustered support from the general public and quickly turned violent to the point where police escorts had to be given to coal convoys in the city, leading to fierce clashes between protesters and law enforcement.\n\nThe once tranquil streets of Moabit have been transformed into a battleground. Barricades made of debris block major intersections, storefronts are shattered, and the sounds of shouts echo through the district. The scale of the unrest is unprecedented, with the thousands of protesters participating in the upheaval, even criticising the Kaiser and his administration itself.\n\nLaw enforcement have managed to gain control over the situation but these events will certainly raise significant support for socialism in Berlin - one can at least hope the violence will come to an end."

#1910 Debate in Prussian Parliment on the "royal civil list"
ww1_germanrework.5.t:0 "Stormy Debate on the 'Royal Civil List'"
 ww1_germanrework.5.d:0 "A debate broke out in the Prussian House of Representatives today after the issue of the 'royal civil list' arose, where payments from the state budget to the royal family were to be increased at the request of the Kaiser. The Social Democrat, Adolf Hofmann told the representatives that the Kaiser already received a daily income of 43,065 marks without the proposed increase. This criticism of the rise infuriated the centrists and right-wing of the house, with the President of the House calling Hofmann a 'traitor'. While the increase is still sure to pass the SPD's revisionist wing has been put under scrutiny from the right after their seemingly 'traitorous' stance on the matter."

 ww1_germanrework.6.d:0 "In a notable session of the Reichstag, the Zentrum has voiced its concerns over the increasing antisemitic rhetoric within the German Empire's political discourse. The party's leaders highlighted the importance of upholding the principles of equality and respect for all citizens, regardless of their religious background.\n\nThis criticism marks a significant moment as the Zentrum, traditionally focused on moderate and pragmatic policies, calls for a more inclusive and tolerant approach. The party's representatives argued that fostering unity and mutual respect is essential for the stability and progress of the nation.\n\nThe reaction to this stance has been mixed. Some political figures and segments of the populace have welcomed the Zentrum's call for moderation, viewing it as a necessary step towards a more harmonious society. Others, however, have dismissed it as overly idealistic and out of touch with the prevailing sentiments."

The law introduces plural voting rights and the direct election of representatives. Accordingly, only male taxpayers over the age of 24 are entitled to vote, but those aged 50 and over receive an additional vote.

As of the moment, the owners of the mines have yet to even attempt to negotiate with the strikes, clearly planning to wait out the strike. The strike has only been encouraged by the falling standards of living and safety in the mines.\n\nThe SPD has come to the support of the strikes, using them as a stepping stool to gain support among the local workers, the centrists have already shifted to the right in response, proposing financial aid to the owners of the mines to make up for their losses."

Current deaths are totaled at 115 miners. This follows the strikes in the mines earlier this year and the accident has given the far-left of the Rhur reason to once again begin calling for strikes. Whilst the Kaiser and his people mourn for the dead, a government response to the accident is to be printed in the press soon."

 ww1_germanrework.18.d:0 "The findings of the national census have been delivered and examined by the administration. After reviewing the findings, a document has been prepared to advise the Reichstag and the Kaiser of the conclusions. These documents have highlighted how large portions of the empire lack vital infrastructure compared to our competitors in Europe, mass urbanization has led to housing shortages and public health growth is minimal - even reverting in some cities. These findings have concerned the Chancellor greatly who is keen to introduce legislature, commit new government investments, and bring in foreign experts to help the construction of a new sewer system to battle the poor public health in our key cities.\n\nThe findings of the national census have not been what many expected and will no doubt play a big part in the left's push for an increase in the Empire's social spending."

It's expected that the topics of discussion will follow the tense military and diplomatic situation in Europe. Specific topics will naturally focus on Russia's 'Great Military Plan', Austria-Hungary's concerns about Serbian military action, and the relationship of the Empire with the British.\n\nKnown attendees include Tirpitz, Muller, Molkte, and Heeringen, with an equally strong presence from the Army and the Navy.\n\nAs preparations and talks about Germany's place in a war in Europe, each day brings war closer to the Reich and do doubt, soon legislature will be passed to expand the German armed forces to meet a new era of war."

#Wilhelmine Germany
ww1_germanrework.21.t:0 "Wilhelmine Germany"
 ww1_germanrework.21.d:0 "The dawn of Wilhelmine Germany marked a new era of industrial prowess and ambitious imperialism under the leadership of Kaiser Wilhelm II - ascending to the throne in 1888. Wilhelm II sought to propel Germany into the ranks of global superpowers, adopting a policy of Weltpolitik to expand German influence and secure a 'place in the sun.'\n\nThe economy flourished with rapid industrialization throughout the second industrial revolution, making Germany a leader in steel production, chemicals, and electrical engineering. This industrial boom fostered a burgeoning middle class and significant urbanization, transforming the societal landscape. This allowed Wilhelm to sanction the expansion of the German navy under admiral Alfred von Tirpitz, reflecting his aspirations for a formidable maritime presence to rival that of Great Britain.\n\nInternally, during the Wilhelmine period Germany witnessed the rise of the Social Democratic Party, representing the growing working class and advocating for more radical social reforms. This rise of the left poses challenges to the conservative establishment, necessitating a delicate balance between modernization and maintaining traditional power structures.\n\nOn the international stage, Germany's assertive foreign policy aimed at colonial expansion and securing alliances created tensions with other European powers - something that has led Germany to become diplomatically isolated and even 'encircled' by the triple entente. However, the formation of the Triple Alliance with Austria-Hungary and Italy still stands and in those two powers, Germany still has some friends left within the content.\n\nFor now, Wilhelmine Germany stands as a testament to the industrial strength of Germany, and her resolve through the many crises she has, and will, face."

#Socialism in Germany
ww1_germanrework.22.t:0 "Socialism in the German Empire"
 ww1_germanrework.22.d:0 "Since the unification of Germany; 1877, the SPD has grown in popularity exponentially. Unlike the right wing of the Reichstag, the left is mostly unified under the SPD with both moderate social democrats and revisionist republicans holding seats for the party's faction. However, the FVp's faction in the Reichstag also holds significant sway in the leftist wing.\n\nOutside of the Reichstag the workers of Germany are significantly unionized under moderate worker's unions - as of late the unions have become more and more restless, and working conditions in the industries have slowly declined with Germany's rise in demand. If not dealt with properly the unions have the power to cripple the economy, the government's saving grace is that the unions are decentralized without a common purpose, allowing the chancellor to make slower reforms that won't upset either the balance of power or the right-wing of the Reichstag."

It has it's roots in Goethe University, which was established in 1484, but was not officially considered to be one under German customs, as it did not issue degrees for almost half a millennia. Funded by several people and groups, notably the security dealers in the Speyer family; Wilhelm Ralph Merton, the founder of Metallgesellschaft AG; Arthur von Weinberg, co-owner of the historic Cassella chemical company, and the former director of Senckenberg Nature Research Society; and various other families and local elites.\n\nRoyal approval for Universität Frankfurt am Main was granted on June 10th, 1914, and enrollment began in mid-October."

However, it seems that the Kaiser and Hollweg have found coming ground - pheasant shooting. The visit has been extended by a day so that the Kaiser and the Chancellor may make a small excursion into the countryside to take on a morning of pheasant shooting.

The press reports that Forstner told his soldiers, 'If you are attacked, then make use of your weapon; if you stab such a Wackes in the process, then you'll get ten marks from me.'

Unfortunately, unimpressed by these actions, the Alsatian public continued to protest. As a further provocation, Lieutenant Forstner was reported to go out and aggravate the public after having his punishment repealed.

As if matters couldn't have gotten worse, not only has the press been alerted that Wilhelm was practically forced to leave his hunting vacation at Donauschingen to deal with the crisis by his own wife, but they are now also publishing papers that criticise the Kaiser for seemingly only heeding the viewpoint of the military - even excluding the chancellor from meetings.\n\nChancellor von Hollweg has now been put into a tricky position by the Kaiser, it is his constitutional duty to support the Kaiser in all affairs and placate the Reichstag in his name. However, the Reichstag are beginning to call for a censure vote where they will show their disproval to the Kaiser by recommending that he replaces his chancellor - as is their right. Therefore, to retain his position, and for the betterment of the Reich, Hollweg could instead align himself with the Reichstag and join the demands for justice."

GER_preparing_for_the_haldane_mission_desc:0 "Our negotiations with the British have always been stifled by §cTirpitz's§! ambitions for a grand German navy that would be able to challenge Britain's dominance on the seas - and now §cTirpitz§! whishes to pass a fith fleet act. On the other hand, the chancellor has made significant efforts to slow down the naval expansion, these efforts have been noticed by Britain and seemingly have un-alienated them from us. Now §rHollweg§! has taken action to invite the British to Germany to draw the two nations togeather by officially ending the naval race in exchange for British neutrality in future European conflicts. §rHollweg§! has warned the Kaiser that any hint of naval expansion would make his efforts worthless and drive the British away for good.\n\nNow both §cTirpitz§! and §rHollweg§! battle for influence over the Kaiser to convince him to support their own aims.\nCurrently the stance the Kaiser takes is [GER_influence_battle]"

ww1_germanrework.33.t:0 "The Haldane Mission Scuppered"
ww1_germanrework.33.d:0 "The time has finally come and the British diplomats have arrived in Germany. Upon their arrival, a memorandum, prepared by Sir Edward Grey, Winston Churchill, and Lloyd George, was given to the Kaiser. This memorandum outlined 3 proposals:\n\n1. Fundamental. Naval superiority was recognized as essential to Great Britain. Present German naval program and expenditure not to be increased, but if possible retarded and reduced.\n2. England sincerely desires not to interfere with German Colonial expansion. To give effect to this she is prepared forthwith to discuss whatever the German aspirations in that direction may be. England will be glad to know that there is a field or special points where she can help Germany.\n3. Proposals for reciprocal assurances debarring either power from joining in aggressive designs or combinations against the other would be welcome.\n\nIt's clear that the main goal of the British is to secure their naval dominance, an expected aim. However, they were also clearly willing to offer major concessions, the Kaiser and his advisors were extremely interested in the clause that would allow Germany to pursue further colonial goals. On top of this, Hollweg is especially pleased with the third clause that would suggest that the UK and Germany could even pursue further treaties.\n\nHowever, this visit took a turn for the worse when, under the influence of Tirpitz, Wilhelm pushed for a new naval bill to be passed in the Reichstag. This seemingly anti-British expansion has sent the diplomats packing and any chance of detente, dead in the water. Chancellor Hollweg is sure to be furious; his work has been scuppered."

Within the governmental structure of the Reich, it represents the national and democratic element of the empire - alongside the federalism of the Bundesrat and the monarchic element of the governemtn, embodied in the Reich chancellor. Together with the Bundesrat, the Reichstag holds legislative power and shared in decision-making on Imperial law.\n\nLaws must be passed in the Reichstag before being sent through the Bundestrat, each law will be supported by different parties depending on their politcal alignment, the more powerful the party, the more votes the law will obtain. However, we can still lobby support from other parties."
