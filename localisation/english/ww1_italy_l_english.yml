ww1_italy.13.t: "Breakneck Industrialization"
ww1_italy.13.d: "It is no secret that our status as a great power lies with the north, not the south. The duchies and republics that made Northern Italy their home were able to consolidate and advance to greater heights because of the relative peace. The predecessor to our nation, Sardinia-Piedmont, is such an example. n/n/The south has, in contrast, laid in a state of disrepair for over a thousand years, exploited by the Arabs, the French, and the Spaniards. It is a shame to say our current policies do much of the same. n/n/All these pieces of history have shaped the way Italy is today: from the top down. The problem is, the wealth never trickles down, it only flows to the north. It is a price we must bear as a nation, yet only one part does so. Our industrial might shall remain concentrated in Turin, Milan, and the Venetian countryside for as long as this remains. It does not look like it will change anytime soon, but that is just another sad story in the annals of the history of our peninsula."
ww1_italy.13.a: "It's a necessary arrangement"
ww1_italy.9.t: "Universal Suffrage Bill Fails to Pass"
ww1_italy.9.d: "Devestating news has come out of parliament. The vote failed, the law is dead. The laws failure to pass came as several center right legislators flipped against the bill - enough so to stop it from passing."
ww1_italy.9.a: "Unfortunate"
ww1_italy.8.t: "Universal Suffrage Bill Proposed to Parliament "
ww1_italy.8.d: "This is it. A defining moment for Luzzatti's premiership. With the introduction of Universal Suffrage to parliament, we must do whatever we can to get it passed. If we can sucessfully pass it, we can prove to Italians that we are capable of governing sucessfully. It won't be easy, however. The right has put up a unified front against the bill, and they're swaying many centrists. "
ww1_italy.8.a: "Ride or die!"
ww1_italy.7.t: "Death of the Mandate"
ww1_italy.7.d: "With our failure to pass electoral reform, it seems our mandate - and government, are toast. The centrists want Giolitti back, the catholics want a new conservative prime minister, the socialists were never never going to support us, neither were the far right. With pretty much every faction of the government wanting us gone, it's basically inevitable the government will be pushed out by a vote of no confidence soon, unless we resign before then."
ww1_italy.6.t: "Universal Male Suffrage Bill Fails to Pass"
ww1_italy.6.d: "Devestating news has come out of parliament. The vote failed, the law is dead. The laws failure to pass can be mostly blamed on the socialists, who refused to vote for the bill as they saw the bill as not going far enough."
ww1_italy.6.a: "Unfortunate"
ww1_italy.5.t: "Universal Male Suffrage Bill Proposed to Parliament"
ww1_italy.5.d: "This is it. A defining moment for Luzzatti's premiership. With the introduction of Universal Male Suffrage to parliament, we must do whatever we can to get it passed. If we can sucessfully pass it, we can prove to Italians that we are capable of governing sucessfully. It won't be easy, however. There are worries that some on the far left or right may try to rally against the bill. "
ww1_italy.5.a: "Let's hope it passes!"
ww1_italy.1.t: "Giolitti's Support"
ww1_italy.1.d: "Giovanni Giolitti, one of the most influencial Italian politicians who has served as Prime Minister 3 times already, has offered Giolitti lukewarm political support for his agenda. With his massive influence amongst centrist PM's, he'll help us get some of our proposed laws through parliament.\n\nThe problem, however, is that this support is quite conditional. With Luzzatti being noticably more left wing on several issues compared to Giolitti, Giolitti is expecting us to moderate our agenda. If we don't, he won't hesitate to end his support of our government."
ww1_italy.1.a: "We'll need to perfect the balancing act"
ww1_italy.2.t: "Our New "Friends""
ww1_italy.2.d: "Many in the PSI have been... apprehensive to working with centrists. From their eyes, working with moderate liberals to push smaller reforms then they hope for would only help to entrench the centrist domination of Italian politics, as pushing smaller reforms could satisfy parts of the electorate who want change, but not revolutionary change. A lot of the power base of the PSI comes from angry ordinary citizens, and keeping them angry at the system is key for their electoral performance. Thus, it's likely around half of the PSI will oppose our reforms no matter what, unless we capitulate to their demands. Still though, it's hard to argue our recent overtures to the PSI have been useless. We have indeed secured a small base of support from their party to our upcoming agenda."
ww1_italy.2.a: "The radicals are putting politics over the people!"
ww1_italy.3.t: "The Clock Ticks"
ww1_italy.3.d: "Many Italian political analysis are seeing Luzzatti's government as inevitable to fall in due time. After all, the socialists see him as a milquetoast liberal who refuses to bring any real change to the country,catholics don't exactly see him as pushing their interests, ultra nationalists at best see him as weak, and the centrists prefer Giolitti. Luzzatti, they theorize, doesn't have a strong base of support amongst any faction. If he wants his government to avoid a no confidence vote, he's going to have to make new friends."
ww1_italy.3.a: "They have a point"
ww1_italy.4.t: "Our New Friends"
ww1_italy.4.d: "Luzzatti has always leaned slightly to the the left of center, which has caused many in the center right to take a disliking to him. With his government being viewed as being at risk of a no confidence vote, it's clear mending relations with the center right would be the easiest way to avoid it. Thus, Luzzatti has begun making significant overtures to the center right, promising to moderate social rhetoric and give them significant input on his suffrage bill that he plans to introduce to parliament soon. The attempts at mending relations have been met favorably amongst the center right for now, although many of them still favor a new prime minister - someone like Giolitti."

ITA_government_stability_desc: "Signore Luzzati may be strong financier, but is he a strong prime minister? The answer is a resounding no. The opposition? Total lack of willingness to confront. Doing what needs to be done for the sake of the nation? Not if it makes him unpopular, no sir. It is only a matter of time before he falls, and so falls his half-realized ideals. Half-realized is generous, really. "

The south remains in the exploited state that it has been under for a millenium and the integration of citizens under the Austrian umbrella has proven quite the challenge. These issues that permeate our relatively new state need to be addressed. In fact, they should have been addressed a decade ago, at the turn of the century, or even five decades ago, on the momentum of the Risorgimento. No matter, the time  remains ripe to transform the nation in order to meet a changing world. \n\nShatter the outdated standards of old! Bring a new industrial revolution to our southern kin! Create an Italy that shall bring its enemies to their knees and fulfill the promise of our nation!"
