#A meeting in Ireland
ww1_easter_uprising.1.t: "A Meeting in Ireland"
 ww1_easter_uprising.1.d: "The Supreme Council of the IRB met just over a month after the British government have declared war on Germany. At this meeting, they elected to stage an uprising before the war ended and to secure help from Germany. Responsibility for the planning of the rising was given to Tom Clarke and Seán Mac Diarmada. Patrick Pearse, Michael Joseph O'Rahilly, Joseph Plunkett, and Bulmer Hobson.\n\nThis uprising could very well end a farce, simply leaving good men martyrs, or it could be the start of an Irish state."

#The Easter Uprising Fails
ww1_easter_uprising.2.t: "The Easter Uprising"
 ww1_easter_uprising.2.d: "The streets of Dublin erupted in rebellion. Irish nationalists, led by figures such as Patrick Pearse and James Connolly, seized key locations and declared an independent Irish Republic. Our forces have swiftly responded, deploying armed men to quash the uprising. After several days of arresting rebels in the countryside, the uprising has been defeated. Dublin, and Ireland, are once again under British control, but the seeds of unrest in Ireland remain."

 ww1_easter_uprising_cat_desc: "With the opportunity of war, the §GIrish§! have begun to plot against the status quo. If the war continues it's all but guaranteed that there will be an uprising of some kind in §GIreland§! against §QBritish§! rule. The success of this uprising, however, will be heavily dependent on whether the §GIrish§! Can hide their scheme from §Qoccupying forces§!, organize their own, and muster §gGerman§! support.\n\n([IRE.GetFlag]) §GIrish§!

If total readiness exceeds §Y50§!%, the §QBritish§! will have to face open rebbelion in §GIreland§!, which may lead to an independent §GIrish§! state being established. Should total readiness reach too high the §GIrish§! may preemptively rise up..."
