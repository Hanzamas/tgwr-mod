#Agadir aftermath
ww1_germanrework.1.t:0 "Germany's Disgrace"
 ww1_germanrework.1.d:0 "Despite the grandiose posturing and saber-rattling, the end result of the Agadir crisis has been a diplomatic embarrassment. The crisis not only revealed Germany's weak position in the global arena but also severely damaged its prestige. The failure to secure any significant gains from the showdown with France has led to widespread criticism from both within the government and the general public. The Treaty of Fez, which concluded the crisis, saw Germany receive meager concessions in the Congo while France consolidated its hold over Morocco, a clear indicator of German diplomatic failure.\n\nThe public and political backlash has been particularly harsh on Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg, whose handling of the situation is seen as weak and indecisive. Many view his leadership as responsible for the national humiliation, arguing that a stronger stance or better negotiation tactics could have yielded more favorable outcomes. The Chancellor's popularity has plummeted, and there is a growing call for his dismissal as a means to restore confidence in the government's ability to uphold German interests and prestige on the world stage. The question now facing the Kaiser is whether to replace Hollweg in hopes of revitalizing the leadership or to endure the current political turmoil with the same leadership."

 ww1_germanrework.2.a:0 "Good luck to the new chancellor"
ww1_germanrework.19.t:0 "Factions in the Right"
 ww1_germanrework.19.d:0 "The new chancellor is no staunch negotiator like von Hollweg was and will now have to manage the right-wing in his favor if he wishes to stay in power. The traditionalist conservatives and the pan-German nationalists see this as an opportunity to assert their influence over the right-wing factions that the new Chancellor relies on to stay in power. These nationalistic groups, driven by a desire to restore German prestige after the crisis and assert a more aggressive national policy, are vying for control and seeking to push their agendas within the Reichstag.\n\nAmidst this internal power struggle, the Chancellor faces another critical challenge':' the looming threat of the Social Democratic Party in the upcoming 1912 election. The SPD's growing popularity poses a significant risk to the current administration's stability and conservative values. To maintain power and prevent a potential shift in political dominance, the Chancellor must navigate the complex dynamics of right-wing politics, appeasing influential factions while also formulating strategies to curtail the SPD's appeal to the masses. The next few months will be pivotal in determining the future direction of Germany, as the new Chancellor strives to consolidate power and guide the nation through these turbulent times."

#1910 Strikes
ww1_germanrework.3.t:0 "Strikes in Hamburg"
 ww1_germanrework.3.d:0 "Earlier this morning a strike was called in the shipbuilding yards at Hamburg, our principal commercial seaport, current reports estimate that around ten thousand employees have ceased their work. The strike was supported by (and catalysed) by the Deutscher Transportarbeiter-Verband who have been a consistent thorn in the Kaiser's side since their formation earlier this year; highlighting to many within and outside the empire that the rise of socialism in Germany is a real threat to the Kaiser's power.\n\nThe ringleaders of the strike have threatened to continue the strike until their demands of higher wages and shorter hours have been met. Although the demands have been to little avail as the employers are persistent in denying the strikers out of fear of enabling further industrial action. Only time will tell whether the strikers' demands will be met but either way, Germany is sure to suffer more strikes as a consequence soon."

ww1_germanrework.4.t:0 "Clashes with Strikers in Berlin"
 ww1_germanrework.4.d:0 "In the heart of Berlin's industry, the district of Moabit has erupted into chaos. Due to the coal industry's lethal competitiveness, the workers at Kupfer and Co. (recently brought by the most ruthless capitalist in the country - Hugo Stinnes) who have received the short end of this competitiveness through diminishing wages and poor working conditions, have begun a major strike with tens of thousands of workers absent from the coal pits. Initially peaceful, the demonstration mustered support from the general public and quickly turned violent to the point where police escorts had to be given to coal convoys in the city, leading to fierce clashes between protesters and law enforcement.\n\nThe once tranquil streets of Moabit have been transformed into a battleground. Barricades made of debris block major intersections, storefronts are shattered, and the sounds of shouts echo through the district. The scale of the unrest is unprecedented, with the thousands of protesters participating in the upheaval, even criticising the Kaiser and his administration itself.\n\nLaw enforcement have managed to gain control over the situation but these events will certainly raise significant support for socialism in Berlin - one can at least hope the violence will come to an end."

#Wilhelmine Germany
ww1_germanrework.21.t:0 "Wilhelmine Germany"
 ww1_germanrework.21.d:0 "The dawn of Wilhelmine Germany marked a new era of industrial prowess and ambitious imperialism under the leadership of Kaiser Wilhelm II - ascending to the throne in 1888. Wilhelm II sought to propel Germany into the ranks of global superpowers, adopting a policy of Weltpolitik to expand German influence and secure a 'place in the sun.'\n\nThe economy flourished with rapid industrialization throughout the second industrial revolution, making Germany a leader in steel production, chemicals, and electrical engineering. This industrial boom fostered a burgeoning middle class and significant urbanization, transforming the societal landscape. This allowed Wilhelm to sanction the expansion of the German navy under admiral Alfred von Tirpitz, reflecting his aspirations for a formidable maritime presence to rival that of Great Britain.\n\nInternally, during the Wilhelmine period Germany witnessed the rise of the Social Democratic Party, representing the growing working class and advocating for more radical social reforms. This rise of the left poses challenges to the conservative establishment, necessitating a delicate balance between modernization and maintaining traditional power structures.\n\nOn the international stage, Germany's assertive foreign policy aimed at colonial expansion and securing alliances created tensions with other European powers - something that has led Germany to become diplomatically isolated and even 'encircled' by the triple entente. However, the formation of the Triple Alliance with Austria-Hungary and Italy still stands and in those two powers, Germany still has some friends left within the content.\n\nFor now, Wilhelmine Germany stands as a testament to the industrial strength of Germany, and her resolve through the many crises she has, and will, face."

It has it's roots in Goethe University, which was established in 1484, but was not officially considered to be one under German customs, as it did not issue degrees for almost half a millennia. Funded by several people and groups, notably the security dealers in the Speyer family; Wilhelm Ralph Merton, the founder of Metallgesellschaft AG; Arthur von Weinberg, co-owner of the historic Cassella chemical company, and the former director of Senckenberg Nature Research Society; and various other families and local elites.\n\nRoyal approval for Universität Frankfurt am Main was granted on June 10th, 1914, and enrollment began in mid-October."

Max Planck - a theoretical physicist who served as president of the German Physical Institute from 1905 to 1909, and creator of Planck's Constant - and Walther Nernst - friend of Kaiser Wilhelm II and thermodynamic physicist - convinced Einstein to take these jobs. He settled in Dahlem on April 1st, 1914."
