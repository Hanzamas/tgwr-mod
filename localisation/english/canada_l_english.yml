canada.1.t: "For Continued Prosperity"
canada.1.d: "The Laurier premiership has seen a large increase in the prosperity of Canada, with its population soaring and its economy beginning to modernize. Overseeing a policy of increased immigration, full integration of western territories into Canadas political system, and the expansion of railways to connect the vast country together, the liberal rule can hardly be called unsucessful. However, with the liberals having ruled Canada for nearly 20 years straight, there is a level of fatigue building up as voters seek a change in leadership. With the 1911 elections looking like the next party will have a slim majority at best, our policies leading up to the election will be crucial towards swinging the electorate one way or another."

canada.2.t:0 "Increased Racial Tensions in British Columbia"
canada.2.d:0 "The rapid increase in immigration in the last few decades has led to many of the white Canadian with British decent to be suspicious of immigrants coming from places like Africa and India. Several local officals are blatanly encouraging discrimination, while those in the conservative party have been campaigning on lowering immigration as of late. With our policy of continuing to encourage this immigration, which has helped our economy in rural areas of the country, has led to increased racial tensions in British Columbia."
