One of the main issues it has is that any systemic change is either delayed as much as possible or is rejected completely for political concerns.

However, the October Manifesto did not turn Russian Empire into democracy and didn't solve the underlying economic conditions, which caused the §Rrevolution§! in the first place.\n\nTo reform Russia, we have to §Ypass legislation§! in the §YState Duma§! and §YState Council§! and §Yfund§! the reform efforts.
