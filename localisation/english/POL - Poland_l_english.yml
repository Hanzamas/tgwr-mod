 POL_jozef_pilsudski_desc:0 "A social and independence activist, former leader of the Polish Socialist Party, founder of the PPS Fighting Organisation and the Polish Military Organisation, commander of the 1st Brigade of the Polish Legions; Józef Piłsudski, surrounded by a cult among his soldiers and supporters, hated by his political enemies is a charismatic individual seeking to exercise dictatorial power in Poland as Chief of State. His character resembles the 18th century romantic and charismatic megalomaniac, his idol is Napoleon Bonaparte, whom he admires and whose spirit was to fly over the Pilsudski family's house at the birth of Józef. The Commandant, so called by his soldiers, is a supporter of the imperial Poland as a guide of the federation of countries located between the Baltic and the Black Sea. In fact, an anti-Russian, former Siberian exile, Piłsudski would most like to see Russia within its ethnographic borders. During his imprisonment in Magdeburg by the Germans, his legend in the country grew significantly and he became a person who could count on the support of society and left-wing parties during the growing social and revolutionary moods in Poland. The handing over of power to him by the Regency Council led to the moment for which Józef Piłsudski and his supporters was waiting for, becoming a dictator of Poland. However, Polish society is striving to rebuild the country on democratic principles and to restore the Sejm, the Polish Parliament. At such an important moment for Poland, the Commandant is conscious of the need to cooperate with all parties in the country and to strive for the formation of the Sejm, but this does not mean that he will resign from the function of the Chief of the State and stop strengthening his position and building his cult in society and the army, using the intrigues he has learned during the hard times of conspiracy. One thing is certain, Józef Piłsudski plays his own game about Poland and nobody really knows how it will end, quoting the Commandant: "My head is full of the wildest contradictions!""
 POLITICS_REGENCY_COUNCIL_1918_DESC:0 "The Regency Council was established by the German and Austro-Hungarian occupation authorities on the basis of the patent on state authority in the Kingdom of Poland of 12 September 1917 granted by these authorities. Is composed of Aleksander Kakowski, Zdzisław Lubomirski and Józef Ostrowski. Power of the Regency Council were limited in favour of the occupants - in cases where the administration was not transferred to the Polish state authority. The Regency Council appointed the first Polish government under the leadership of Jan Kucharzewski. This government took over the administration departments, transferred by the occupying authorities. Protesting against the agreement of a peace treaty between the Central Powers and Ukraine on February 13, 1918, the Regency Council announced that it would exercise the right to power based on the will of the Nation, believing that the Nation wishes to have a symbol of its independence and intends to stand around this symbol. On October 7, 1918, the Regency Council proclaimed Poland's independence, citing 14 Wilson's points accepted a few days earlier by the Central Powers, and on October 12, the Regency Council took over from the occupiers power over the army. On 21 October, the German General Governor of Warsaw, Hans von Beseler, submitted the office of the Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Armed Forces. On 25 October, Józef Świeżyński's cabinet was appointed and on 28 October, the RC appointed Gen. Tadeusz Rozwadowski as Head of the General Staff of the Polish Army. The General immediately joined the organisation of the General Staff and the Ministry of Military Affairs. On 3 November, the Świeżyński cabinet tried to carry out a coup d'état against the Council, but the Regency Council removed the cabinet, appointing in its place a provisional governmental chaired by Władysław Wróblewski. On 11 November, the Regency Council handed over the military authority and the command of the Polish army to Józef Piłsudski; the next day, it entrusted him with the mission of forming a government, but in the face of public pressure, it resigned from this intention. The Regents are unpopular among the society and the revolution is highly probable, the fate of Poland depends on their decision."

 POL_central_powers_occupation_desc:0 "The area of the Kingdom of Poland is under occupation by Germany and Austria-Hungary, which ruthlessly exploit it economically. Raw materials, food, industry and labor are subordinated to the war needs of the occupying powers, and the Polish economy is depleted to support their military effort. The future of the Kingdom lies in the hands of foreign powers, which creates frustration and a sense of powerlessness among the population. Opposition to the domination of the Central Powers is growing, while deepening the economic and political crisis in the country."

 POL_unpopular_regency:0 "Unpopular Regency"
 POL_unpopular_regency_desc:0 "Although the Regency Council formally builds the foundations of Polish statehood, its position in society is fragile. Appointed by the occupying German and Austro-Hungarian authorities, the Council is seen as a tool of foreign powers, rather than a true symbol of independence. Many Poles view it with distrust, seeing its actions as a compromise with the occupiers. Despite progress in establishing state structures, the lack of popular support hinders effective governance and deepens political divisions in the country."

 POL_oath_crisis_desc:0 "Faced with the unfair treatment of the Polish cause by the Central Powers, the soldiers of the Polish Legions from the First and Third Brigades, loyal to Józef Piłsudski, refused to take the oath of loyalty to the Kingdom of Poland and to honor the brotherhood of arms to the armies of Germany and Austria-Hungary in the Great War. The Oath Crisis of the legionnaires cast a shadow over the ability to recruit units of the Polish Armed Forces (Polnische Wehrmacht) in the Kingdom and triggered a political crisis in the country."
 POL_governor_general_idea:0 "Governor-General Rule"
 POL_governor_general_idea_desc:0 "Governor-general of Generalgouvernement Warschau Hans Hartwig von Beseler de facto governs the Kingdom of Poland while balancing the realisation of German interests with Polish independence aspirations. His rule in Warsaw is based on a policy of strict control while attempting to maintain a semblance of autonomy and make concessions to the Poles, which arouses mixed feelings among the Polish people. Beseler is seen as a symbol of German occupation, and his rule increases the sense of dependence on foreign powers and the social rift between cooperation and resistance among Poles."
 POL_not_yet_lost: "Poland Is Not Yet Lost!"
 POL_not_yet_lost_desc: "After the Great War and the defeat in it, of all three partitioners, the dream of many generations of Poles about their desired independence finally came true. Years of captivity of Poland being in the shackles of the partitioners, strengthened by the spirit of romanticism and messianism, expressed in the literature of Mickiewicz and Słowacki, bought with the blood shed in the national uprisings of November 1831 and January 1863, intensified the spirit of Poles who fought "For our freedom and yours" wherever they were. The end of the 1860s and the defeats of the national uprisings brought about the strengthening of the idea of positivism on Polish soil, included in the literature of Henryk Sienkiewicz or Bolesław Prus, aiming at organic work at the basis of the development of the Polish nation. The rise and development of Polish nationalism, based on the ideas of positivism and proclaiming the unification of Polish lands from all the partitions, strengthened both physically and materially the Polish nation in its aspiration for an independent state. The beginning of the 1890th brought modernism and neo-Romanticism to Poles, described as "Young Poland", expressed in the prose of Reymont, Żeromski or Wyspiański. This era strengthened expressionism, which gained a lot of attention, especially in socialist circles, which aimed at levelling social inequalities and overthrowing the reactionary order in Europe. The Polish society, which differed in its worldview, had one goal in common; this goal was to regain its statehood and the independence it would defend to the end. "Poland has not yet perished, So long as we still live.""
 POL_ruined_economy: "Ruined Economy"
 POL_ruined_economy_desc: "As a result of Great War activities that lasted at Polish lands for longer than in other countries, large areas often as a result of the plundering policy of the German and Austrian occupiers were ruined. Poland lost about 30% of national wealth during the war. Much about 40% of bridges and 60% of railway stations were destroyed. Industrial and agricultural production decreased considerably, due to the loss of pre-war outlets for domestic production and exports decreased."
 POL_political_instability_1: "Political Instability: §RUpcoming Revolution!§!"
 POL_political_instability_1_desc: "After defeat of the Central Powers, the situation in the Kingdom of Poland is extremely tense and complicated. The war and the destruction associated with it encourage society to adopt socialist and revolutionary proposals. The declaration of independence by the Regency Council and the departure of Governor-General Hans Beseler from the country did not change the attitude of the society towards the regents, who are marked by cooperation with the occupants. At that time, the socialists in Lublin formed the Provisional Government of the Republic of Poland and openly seek to overthrow the reactionary government in Warsaw. There are many centres of power in the country, moods are revolutionary and the Poles have not yet fully taken over the power in the country and there is already a possibility of civil war!"
 POL_political_instability_2: "Political Instability: Not Tolerated Socialist Cabinet"
 POL_political_instability_2_desc: "Despite the control of revolutionary moods, the current socialist cabinet is not tolerated by a large part of Polish society, which does not consider it as a common government of Poland. People with non-Leftist views do not want to pay taxes to the current government, do not agree with many of the reforms that the government announces and strive to establish a universal pro-Entente cabinet. The international situation in which the government finds itself is also to its detriment. Józef Piłsudski, known for his sympathies and influence in left-wing circles, and marked by his cooperation with the Central Powers, is difficult to accept by the Entente, which recognizes the Polish National Committee, residing in Paris, as the rightful government of Poland. One thing is certain, either there will be an inter-party agreement or the government will sooner or later be overthrown."
 POL_political_instability_3: "Political Instability: Relative Compromise"
 POL_political_instability_3_desc: "The conclusion of a compromise between Józef Piłsudski, the Warsaw government and the Polish National Committee in Paris, relaxed the tense atmosphere in the country. The quarrels at the very beginning of independence do not foster political stability or recognition by the victorious powers, which Poland urgently needs. The most important goal now is to hold elections to the Legislative Sejm and to adopt a Constitution that will create the legal basis for a reborn Poland."

The initiators of the failed coup were Colonel Marian Januszajtis-Żegota and Prince Eustachy Sapieha. The ploters intended to arrest key members of the Moraczewski government headed by the Prime Minister himself, with the support of the party militia and some soldiers from the Warsaw garrison, and to proclaim a new government with a national-democratic orientation. Januszajtis informed the commander of the capital about taking over power and going home. The command was manned by the party militia of National Democracy, gendarmes and soldiers who supported the coup. Military telephone communication was blocked and members of Jędrzej Moraczewski's government were arrested, including the Prime Minister himself, the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Leon Wasilewski and the Minister of Internal Affairs Stanisław Thugutt. However, the attempt to arrest the Chief of Staff, General Stanisław Szeptycki was unsuccessful. Szeptycki's forces loyal to the legal authorities surrounded the town hall on Saxon Square, which was occupied by the putschists. Soon the supporters of the Januszajtis putsch surrendered without a fight at five o'clock in the morning, the coup ended in failure. The detained members of the government were released and the putschists were arrested. However, Piłsudski decided only to ridicule the putschists, instead of making them heroes, he scolded them and let them go free."

Also, the Lithuanian government claiming the city, unable to take control of it, withdrew with the Germans. In view of the evacuation of German troops, an attempt to seize power in the city was made by organizations of the far left. In the last days of the German occupation, communist council held two sessions, declared itself the only legal authority in the city and issued the first decrees; its headquarters was a building on Wronia Street.

The sovereign and legislative authority in the Polish State is the Legislative Sejm; laws are promulgated by the Marshal with the countersignature of the Prime Minister and the relevant Minister. \n2. The Chief of State is the representative of the State and the supreme executor of the Sejm's resolutions in civil and military matters. \n3. The Chief of State shall appoint the Government in its full composition on the basis of an agreement with the Sejm.\n4. The Chief of State and the Government are responsible to the Sejm for the exercise of their office. \n5. Each state act of the Chief of State requires the signature of the relevant Minister. \n\nThe Small Constitution introduces a system of committee governance - the highest authority in the state shall be the Legislative Sejm, whose will shall be exercised by the Chief of State and the Council of Ministers, as a kind of committee deprived of its own powers, independent of parliament."

Aiming at the realization of the federal concept, the Chief of State considers the announcement of the appeal as the first step towards gaining the Lithuanians and Belarusians for the alliance with Poland. Piłsudski is conducting a policy of accomplished facts, which is not necessarily liked by a part of the opposition and society, which have the opposite concept of building Poland, an incorporation concept put forward by Roman Dmowski, leader of National Democracy. The attitude of Lithuanians towards Poland is not very positive. Lithuanians have decided to build a national state with the exception of a few provinces south of their ethnic borders, such as Wilno, Suwalki or Grodno, to which Poland also aspires. Wilno is the historical capital of Lithuania and for Lithuanians it is the main target of their territorial claims, however, the majority of the city's population is Polish, according to the 1897 census, in Wilno, Lithuanians constituted only 2% of the population and Poles 30.1%. The Belarusians, on the other hand, do not seem to be a fully developed conscious nation, although they have made an attempt to build their own state of the Belarusian People's Republic, liquidated by the Bolshevik army. According to the Chief, we should strive to reach an understanding with the government in Kaunas and Belarusian national circles and enter into an alliance which is the beginning of federation concept."
