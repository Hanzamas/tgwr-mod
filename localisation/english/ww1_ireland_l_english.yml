ww1_easter_uprising.1.t: "A Meeting in Ireland"
 ww1_easter_uprising.1.d: "The Supreme Council of the IRB met just over a month after the British government have declared war on Germany. At this meeting, they elected to stage an uprising before the war ended and to secure help from Germany. Responsibility for the planning of the rising was given to Tom Clarke and Seán Mac Diarmada. Patrick Pearse, Michael Joseph O'Rahilly, Joseph Plunkett, and Bulmer Hobson.\n\nThis uprising could very well end a farce, simply leaving good men martyrs, or it could be the start of an Irish state."

ww1_easter_uprising_cat: "The Irish Uprising"
 ww1_easter_uprising_cat_desc: "With the opportunity of war, the §GIrish§! have begun to plot against the status quo. If the war continues it's all but guaranteed that there will be an uprising of some kind in §GIreland§! against §QBritish§! rule. The success of this uprising, however, will be heavily dependent on whether the §GIrish§! Can hide their scheme from §Qoccupying forces§!, organize their own, and muster §gGerman§! support.\n\n§QBritish§! Awareness - §Y[?easter_uprising_british_awareness]§!/§Y100§!\n§GIrish§! Organization - §Y[?easter_uprising_irish_organization]§!/§Y100§!\n§gGerman§! Support - §Y[?easter_uprising_german_support]§!/§Y50§!\n\nTotal Readiness - §Y[?easter_uprising_total_readiness]§!/§Y150§!\n\nFor this uprising to be crushed, total readiness must meet or be under a score of 60 - §QBritish§! awareness will be taken away from the total readiness. If the total readiness score exceeds 60, the §QBritish§! will have to face open rebbelion in §GIreland§!, which may lead to an independent §GIrish§! state being established. Should total readiness reach too high the §GIrish§! may preemptively rise up..."
