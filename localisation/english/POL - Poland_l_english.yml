 POL_jozef_pilsudski_desc:0 "A social and independence activist, former leader of the Polish Socialist Party, founder of the PPS Fighting Organisation and the Polish Military Organisation, commander of the 1st Brigade of the Polish Legions; Józef Piłsudski, surrounded by a cult among his soldiers and supporters, hated by his political enemies is a charismatic individual seeking to exercise dictatorial power in Poland as Chief of State. His character resembles the 18th century romantic and charismatic megalomaniac, his idol is Napoleon Bonaparte, whom he admires and whose spirit was to fly over the Piłsudski family's house at the birth of Józef. The Commandant, so called by his soldiers, is a supporter of the imperial Poland as a guide of the federation of countries located between the Baltic and the Black Sea. In fact, an anti-Russian, former Siberian exile, Piłsudski would most like to see Russia within its ethnographic borders. During his imprisonment in Magdeburg by the Germans, his legend in the country grew significantly and he became a person who could count on the support of society and left-wing parties during the growing social and revolutionary moods in Poland. The handing over of power to him by the Regency Council led to the moment for which Józef Piłsudski and his supporters was waiting for, becoming a dictator of Poland. However, Polish society is striving to rebuild the country on democratic principles and to restore the Sejm, the Polish Parliament. At such an important moment for Poland, the Commandant is conscious of the need to cooperate with all parties in the country and to strive for the formation of the Sejm, but this does not mean that he will resign from the function of the Chief of the State and stop strengthening his position and building his cult in society and the army, using the intrigues he has learned during the hard times of conspiracy. One thing is certain, Józef Piłsudski plays his own game about Poland and nobody really knows how it will end, quoting the Commandant: "My head is full of the wildest contradictions!""
 POLITICS_REGENCY_COUNCIL_1918_DESC:0 "The Regency Council was established by the German and Austro-Hungarian occupation authorities on the basis of the patent on state authority in the Kingdom of Poland of 12 September 1917 granted by these authorities. Is composed of Aleksander Kakowski, Zdzisław Lubomirski and Józef Ostrowski. Power of the Regency Council were limited in favour of the occupants - in cases where the administration was not transferred to the Polish state authority. The Regency Council appointed the first Polish government under the leadership of Jan Kucharzewski. This government took over the administration departments, transferred by the occupying authorities. Protesting against the agreement of a peace treaty between the Central Powers and Ukraine on February 13, 1918, the Regency Council announced that it would exercise the right to power based on the will of the Nation, believing that the Nation wishes to have a symbol of its independence and intends to stand around this symbol. On October 7, 1918, the Regency Council proclaimed Poland's independence, citing 14 Wilson's points accepted a few days earlier by the Central Powers, and on October 12, the Regency Council took over from the occupiers power over the army. On 21 October, the German General Governor of Warsaw, Hans von Beseler, submitted the office of the Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Armed Forces. On 25 October, Józef Świeżyński's cabinet was appointed and on 28 October, the RC appointed Gen. Tadeusz Rozwadowski as Head of the General Staff of the Polish Army. The General immediately joined the organisation of the General Staff and the Ministry of Military Affairs. On 3 November, the Świeżyński cabinet tried to carry out a coup d'état against the Council, but the Regency Council removed the cabinet, appointing in its place a provisional governmental chaired by Władysław Wróblewski. On 11 November, the Regency Council handed over the military authority and the command of the Polish army to Józef Piłsudski; the next day, it entrusted him with the mission of forming a government, but in the face of public pressure, it resigned from this intention. The Regents are unpopular among the society and the revolution is highly probable, the fate of Poland depends on their decision."

 POL_act_of_two_emperors:0 "Act of Two Emperors"
 POL_act_of_two_emperors_desc:0 "The issuance of the “Act of the Two Emperors” by the rulers of Germany and Austria-Hungary gives Poles hope for their own state after years of partition. The promise of a constitutional monarchy under the protection of the Central Powers evokes mixed feelings - for some it is the first step toward independence, for others it is a tool of the occupiers to get Polish recruits for the war in the East. The lack of demarcation of borders and silence on the functioning of the Polish government leave many Poles skeptical of the emperors' manifesto. However, the very fact that the Polish cause is becoming the subject of an international game, and that after years of Russification Polish education has begun to function and the foundations of a Polish state are being formed, gives Poles hope that their dream of a free homeland is closer to realization."
 POL_central_powers_occupation:0 "Central Powers Occupation"
 POL_central_powers_occupation_desc:0 "The area of the Kingdom of Poland is under occupation by Germany and Austria-Hungary, which ruthlessly exploit it economically. Raw materials, food, industry and labor are subordinated to the war needs of the occupying powers, and the Polish economy is depleted to support their military effort. The future of the Kingdom lies in the hands of foreign powers, which creates frustration and a sense of powerlessness among the population. Opposition to the domination of the Central Powers is growing, while deepening the economic and political crisis in the country."

 POL_unpopular_regency:0 "Unpopular Regency"
 POL_unpopular_regency_desc:0 "Although the Regency Council formally builds the foundations of Polish statehood, its position in society is fragile. Appointed by the occupying German and Austro-Hungarian authorities, the Council is seen as a tool of foreign powers, rather than a true symbol of independence. Many Poles view it with distrust, seeing its actions as a compromise with the occupiers. Despite progress in establishing state structures, the lack of popular support hinders effective governance and deepens political divisions in the country."
 POL_oath_crisis:0 "Oath Crisis"
 POL_oath_crisis_desc:0 "Faced with the unfair treatment of the Polish cause by the Central Powers, the soldiers of the Polish Legions of the First and Third Brigades, loyal to Józef Piłsudski, refused to swear allegiance to the Kingdom of Poland and honor the brotherhood of arms with the armies of Germany and Austria-Hungary in the Great War. Legionaries who refused to take the oath were interned by the German and Austrian occupation authorities. Following the crisis, Józef Piłsudski and Kazimierz Sosnkowski were arrested. After brief detention in several prisons, Piłsudski was taken to Magdeburg, where he is held in strict isolation in a military fortress. The oath crisis cast a shadow over the ability to recruit units of the Polish Armed Forces (Polnische Wehrmacht) in the Kingdom and triggered a political crisis in the country, leading to the self-dissolution of the Provisional Council of State in protest."
 POL_governor_general_idea:0 "Governor-General Rule"
 POL_governor_general_idea_desc:0 "Governor-general of Generalgouvernement Warschau Hans Hartwig von Beseler de facto governs the Kingdom of Poland while balancing the realisation of German interests with Polish independence aspirations. His rule in Warsaw is based on a policy of strict control while attempting to maintain a semblance of autonomy and make concessions to the Poles, which arouses mixed feelings among the Polish people. Beseler is seen as a symbol of German occupation, and his rule increases the sense of dependence on foreign powers and the social rift between cooperation and resistance among Poles."
 ### INDEPENDENT POLAND ###
 POL_not_yet_lost: "Poland Is Not Yet Lost!"
 POL_not_yet_lost_desc: "After the Great War and the defeat in it, of all three partitioners, the dream of many generations of Poles about their desired independence finally came true. Years of captivity of Poland being in the shackles of the partitioners, strengthened by the spirit of romanticism and messianism, expressed in the literature of Mickiewicz and Słowacki, bought with the blood shed in the national uprisings of November 1831 and January 1863, intensified the spirit of Poles who fought "For our freedom and yours" wherever they were. The end of the 1860s and the defeats of the national uprisings brought about the strengthening of the idea of positivism on Polish soil, included in the literature of Henryk Sienkiewicz or Bolesław Prus, aiming at organic work at the basis of the development of the Polish nation. The rise and development of Polish nationalism, based on the ideas of positivism and proclaiming the unification of Polish lands from all the partitions, strengthened both physically and materially the Polish nation in its aspiration for an independent state. The beginning of the 1890th brought modernism and neo-Romanticism to Poles, described as "Young Poland", expressed in the prose of Reymont, Żeromski or Wyspiański. This era strengthened expressionism, which gained a lot of attention, especially in socialist circles, which aimed at levelling social inequalities and overthrowing the reactionary order in Europe. The Polish society, which differed in its worldview, had one goal in common; this goal was to regain its statehood and the independence it would defend to the end. "Poland has not yet perished, So long as we still live.""
 POL_ruined_economy: "Ruined Economy"
 POL_ruined_economy_desc: "As a result of Great War activities that lasted at Polish lands for longer than in other countries, large areas often as a result of the plundering policy of the German and Austrian occupiers were ruined. Poland lost about 30% of national wealth during the war. Much about 40% of bridges and 60% of railway stations were destroyed. Industrial and agricultural production decreased considerably, due to the loss of pre-war outlets for domestic production and exports decreased."
 POL_political_instability_1: "Political Instability: §RUpcoming Revolution!§!"
 POL_political_instability_1_desc: "After defeat of the Central Powers, the situation in the Kingdom of Poland is extremely tense and complicated. The war and the destruction associated with it encourage society to adopt socialist and revolutionary proposals. The declaration of independence by the Regency Council and the departure of Governor-General Hans Beseler from the country did not change the attitude of the society towards the regents, who are marked by cooperation with the occupants. At that time, the socialists in Lublin formed the Provisional Government of the Republic of Poland and openly seek to overthrow the reactionary government in Warsaw. There are many centres of power in the country, moods are revolutionary and the Poles have not yet fully taken over the power in the country and there is already a possibility of civil war!"
 POL_political_instability_2: "Political Instability: Not Tolerated Socialist Cabinet"
 POL_political_instability_2_desc: "Despite the control of revolutionary moods, the current socialist cabinet is not tolerated by a large part of Polish society, which does not consider it as a common government of Poland. People with non-Leftist views do not want to pay taxes to the current government, do not agree with many of the reforms that the government announces and strive to establish a universal pro-Entente cabinet. The international situation in which the government finds itself is also to its detriment. Józef Piłsudski, known for his sympathies and influence in left-wing circles, and marked by his cooperation with the Central Powers, is difficult to accept by the Entente, which recognizes the Polish National Committee, residing in Paris, as the rightful government of Poland. One thing is certain, either there will be an inter-party agreement or the government will sooner or later be overthrown."
 POL_political_instability_3: "Political Instability: Relative Compromise"
 POL_political_instability_3_desc: "The conclusion of a compromise between Józef Piłsudski, the Warsaw government and the Polish National Committee in Paris, relaxed the tense atmosphere in the country. The quarrels at the very beginning of independence do not foster political stability or recognition by the victorious powers, which Poland urgently needs. The most important goal now is to hold elections to the Legislative Sejm and to adopt a Constitution that will create the legal basis for a reborn Poland."

Polish underground organizations, Polish citizens of Lwów, including the youth, especially students opposed this. It is true that the Ukrainians left the city, but they began the siege as Ukrainian troops surround the area around Lwów.

The initiators of the failed coup were Colonel Marian Januszajtis-Żegota and Prince Eustachy Sapieha. The ploters intended to arrest key members of the Moraczewski government headed by the Prime Minister himself, with the support of the party militia and some soldiers from the Warsaw garrison, and to proclaim a new government with a national-democratic orientation. Januszajtis informed the commander of the capital about taking over power and going home. The command was manned by the party militia of National Democracy, gendarmes and soldiers who supported the coup. Military telephone communication was blocked and members of Jędrzej Moraczewski's government were arrested, including the Prime Minister himself, the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Leon Wasilewski and the Minister of Internal Affairs Stanisław Thugutt. However, the attempt to arrest the Chief of Staff, General Stanisław Szeptycki was unsuccessful. Szeptycki's forces loyal to the legal authorities surrounded the town hall on Saxon Square, which was occupied by the putschists. Soon the supporters of the Januszajtis putsch surrendered without a fight at five o'clock in the morning, the coup ended in failure. The detained members of the government were released and the putschists were arrested. However, Piłsudski decided only to ridicule the putschists, instead of making them heroes, he scolded them and let them go free."

As a result of the negotiations, the German command decided to evacuate the city and not to resist the Polish forces. Also, the Lithuanian government claiming the city, unable to take control of it, withdrew with the Germans. In view of the evacuation of German troops, an attempt to seize power in the city was made by organizations of the far left. In the last days of the German occupation, communist council held two sessions, declared itself the only legal authority in the city and issued the first decrees; its headquarters was a building on Wronia Street. Troops of Polish self-defense under the command of Capt. Dąbrowski attacked the Council building capturing it and taking full control of the city while preparing for the coming of the Bolsheviks."

Until the statutory enactment of this content of the Constitution, which essentially defines the provisions on the organisation of the supreme authorities in the Polish State, the Sejm entrusts Józef Piłsudski with the further exercise of the office of Chief of State, but on certain principles: \n\n1. The sovereign and legislative authority in the Polish State is the Legislative Sejm; laws are promulgated by the Marshal with the countersignature of the Prime Minister and the relevant Minister. \n2. The Chief of State is the representative of the State and the supreme executor of the Sejm's resolutions in civil and military matters. \n3. The Chief of State shall appoint the Government in its full composition on the basis of an agreement with the Sejm.\n4. The Chief of State and the Government are responsible to the Sejm for the exercise of their office. \n5. Each state act of the Chief of State requires the signature of the relevant Minister. \n\nThe Small Constitution introduces a system of committee governance - the highest authority in the state shall be the Legislative Sejm, whose will shall be exercised by the Chief of State and the Council of Ministers, as a kind of committee deprived of its own powers, independent of parliament."

 ww1_poland.31.desc:0 "After the successful Wilno Operation and the capture of the capital of Lithuania, the time has come for an appeal to its inhabitants. Aiming at the realization of the federal concept, the Chief of State considers the announcement of the appeal as the first step towards gaining the Lithuanians and Belarusians for the alliance with Poland. Piłsudski is conducting a policy of accomplished facts, which is not necessarily liked by a part of the opposition and society, which have the opposite concept of building Poland, an incorporation concept put forward by Roman Dmowski, leader of National Democracy. The attitude of Lithuanians towards Poland is not very positive. Lithuanians have decided to build a national state with the exception of a few provinces south of their ethnic borders, such as Wilno, Suwalki or Grodno, to which Poland also aspires. Wilno is the historical capital of Lithuania and for Lithuanians it is the main target of their territorial claims, however, the majority of the city's population is Polish, according to the 1897 census, in Wilno, Lithuanians constituted only 2% of the population and Poles 30.1%. The Belarusians, on the other hand, do not seem to be a fully developed conscious nation, although they have made an attempt to build their own state of the Belarusian People's Republic, liquidated by the Bolshevik army. According to the Chief, we should strive to reach an understanding with the government in Kaunas and Belarusian national circles and enter into an alliance which is the beginning of federation concept."

Piłsudski, through Leon Wasilewski, tries to reach an agreement with Lithuania government. The concept of parallel elections on lands occupied by both Lithuanian and Polish authorities is to be chosen as the basis. Two representatives of these two territories, chosen on completely identical bases, would come together in Vilnius and form a common parliament. "

Lithuanian intelligence had uncovered a plot by the Polish Military Organization (POW) to overthrow the Council of State and the Lithuanian government and replace them with a pro-Polish-oriented cabinet that would agree to reunite with Poland. Fearing that members of the POW had managed to infiltrate the structures of the Lithuanian armed forces, the Lithuanians decided in secret to carry out mass arrests of Poles. Not knowing exactly who was behind the coup plans, the Lithuanians arrested most of the prominent Polish activists in Kaunas. Dozens were arrested on the first night, including Jurgis Aukštuolaitis and 23 Polish officers serving in the Lithuanian army, and General Silvestras Žukauskas, who according to the conspirators was to become the dictator of Lithuania, was removed from his position as commander of the Lithuanian armed forces. Over the next night, the number of arrested Poles rose to two hundred, and a state of siege was declared in Kaunas. The conspirators were arrested, and Lithuania condemned the incident as “a blatant act of aggression on the part of Warsaw.” The incident is considered a new provocation in the already tense situation between the two countries and makes it even more difficult to realize Piłsudski's federation concept."

 ww1_poland.45.desc:0 "A student strike broke out in Warsaw, sparked by frustration over the Germans' failure to deliver on their promises contained in the Act of the Two Emperors. The lack of progress in creating an independent Polish army and the city's increasingly serious food supply problems further heightened tensions. In early May 1917, German police beat and then arrested several students of the University and the Warsaw Polytechnic, accusing them of participating in a rally on May 3 and "resistance to the authorities." Instead of calming the mood, the threat of closing the university intensified it. Representatives of the striking students met with the Marshal of the Provisional Council of State, Władysław Niemojowski, and the President of Warsaw, Prince Zdzisław Lubomirski, who appealed for an end to the protest. During further talks with the Inter-Party Political Circle and the National Council, the politicians promised to take action to make the university independent of the occupation authorities. Governor-General Hans Hardwig von Beseler responded to the strike with a critical speech, condemning the students and emphasizing the need for "internal discipline" in the face of the German occupation authorities. The tone of Beseler's speech gave no hope that the demands of the academic youth would be met."

Faced with this threat, Polish underground organizations and the city's residents, including Polish youth, spontaneously took up arms to defend Lwów. Young volunteers stood on the front lines, fighting for every inch of the city. Polish politicians established the Polish National Committee under the leadership of Ernest Adam, leader of the National Democracy in Lwów, and Tadeusz Cieński, representing the conservatives (Podolacy). The Committee temporarily serves as the highest Polish authority in Lwów. The Committee established the Supreme Command of the Polish Army headed by Captain Czesław Mączyński. In an appeal to the Polish population, the Committee calls on them to report to Polish units and to submit to the authority of the Supreme Command of the Polish Army. The city expects help from Warsaw."

The formation of the Provisional Government is a coup d'état against the authority of the Regency Council, whose representative in Lublin was placed under house arrest, and the new cabinet took over administration and military authority. This government, composed mainly of representatives of the left, supported by units of the Polish Military Organization (POW) under the command of Edward Śmigły-Rydz, in its manifesto promised far-reaching social and agrarian reforms, and openly called for the overthrow of the Regency Council in Warsaw. In addition, the 2nd Battalion of the 2nd Infantry Regiment of the Polish Armed Forces, stationed in Lublin, numbering 650 soldiers, was interned and, after negotiations, went over to the side of the Provisional Government. The proclamation of the Lublin government deepened political divisions in the country and made it more difficult to take control of the emerging Poland."

On the next night, Polish soldiers disarmed the Austrian garrison, liquidating the Austrian administration in Cieszyn Silesia. The National Council proposes to settle the question of borders between Poland and the Czechs in a spirit of agreement, based on national affiliation and the will of the population. However, tensions with the Czechs, who also claim part of the area, could threaten the stability of the region."

Despite attempts to present the manifesto in the spirit of national unification, its leftist tone did not convince either the left or the Piłsudskiites, which rejected the offer of cooperation. The coup attempt failed, and the Regency Council immediately dismissed Świezyński, which the prime minister accepted without resistance. The country found itself in crisis, without a functioning Council of Ministers, and power passed to the provisional government of Władysław Wróblewski. The failed coup attempt highlights the power crisis facing the Regency Council."

Kucharzewski's government repeatedly sought the opportunity to participate in the negotiations, but all attempts to influence the decisions of Berlin and Vienna proved unsuccessful. The Germans, determined to make peace with Russia at any cost, signed a treaty to cede Chelm region to Ukrainian administration. The treaty's provisions provoked widespread outrage in the Kingdom and further weakened the authority of both the government and the Regency Council. Faced with this situation, on [?global.date.GetDateStringNoHourLong], Jan Kucharzewski's government submits its resignation, which was accepted. Despite this, the Regency Council decides not to immediately appoint a new government, and entrusted current affairs to the Council of Ministry Heads headed by Antoni Ponikowski.

General Hans Hartwig von Beseler, struggling with the shortage of Polish recruits, came up with proposals for a settlement that would open up new opportunities for negotiation. Jan Kanty Steczkowski, responding to these initiatives, put forward demands in his memorial to secure Poland's position in the future Mitteleuropa arrangement. Steczkowski demanded, among other things, a plebiscite in Chełm region and Podlasie, negotiations on the future of Vilnius, Belarus and Galicia, as well as gaining Polish access to the sea, through Vistula, which was to be guaranteed in the Polish-German trade treaty. These demands, although somewhat at odds with Berlin's interests, met with the general acceptance of Governor General von Beseler. As a result, on [?global.date.GetDateStringNoHourLong].

They are outraged above all by the vision of handing over Chełm region to Ukraine. At the joint appeal of all Polish political parties, an eight-hour general strike was organized, which turned into violent street demonstrations. Officials, teachers, clergy and even judges participated. The demonstrations often began with church services, and decorated Poles demonstratively sent back their orders. The governor of Galicia alone received about 700 of them. The demonstrators also attach the orders and medals to trees in Kraków's Planty Park or hang them on dogs' collars and tails. Austrian signs and flags are spontaneously torn from public buildings, and in schools, in place of portraits of [AUH.GetLeader], students hang effigies of Józef Piłsudski, who is imprisoned in Magdeburg. In Kraków's market square, someone displayed an image of the crucified Christ adjacent to portraits of [GER.GetLeader] and [AUH.GetLeader]. Under the installation was the caption: “Jesus Christ, you have never yet hung on the cross in the company of such scoundrels.” Numerous articles critical of the monarchy appeared in the press, proving Polish rights to these lands. The underground press is also flourishing. During a debate in the parliament in Vienna, MP Ignacy Daszyński expressed his opinion, stating that “the Habsburg star has been extinguished in the Polish sky,” and the Polish Circle announced a move to the opposition. This decision negatively affects the morale of Poles in Habsburg uniforms. In a gesture of defiance, General Stanisław Szeptycki resigned from his post as governor-general of Lublin, and with him many other Poles employed in the occupation authorities. Demonstrations take on an increasingly anti-German character - in Lemberg and Kraków, German offices are destroyed, and the gendarmerie has difficulty maintaining order. The decisions made in Brest-Litovsk finally undermine the loyalty of Poles to the Habsburg monarchy, and the crisis deepens."

In Warsaw, under German control, there was a general strike on [?global.date.GetDateStringNoHourLong] - manufacturing companies, institutions, stores and restaurants stood down, and carriages and streetcars did not take to the streets. Workers destroyed some of the equipment at the city's power plant to prevent the occupation authorities from forcing streetcar drivers into the city. As a sign of national mourning, cinemas and theaters were closed and carnival games were canceled. Maps with areas to be annexed to Ukraine circled in red appear in store windows. People on the streets of Warsaw openly expressed anger against the occupation authorities, destroying offices and breaking windows in Austrian and German buildings. Demonstrators burned portraits of the emperors, and in the Chelm region, Poles massively nailed cards to their doors with the words: “Here lives a Pole.” Polish government resigned, and the Regency Council demonstratively suspended all contacts with the Central States. Voices of indignation are also heard in the lands of the Empire inhabited by Poles - in Posen, the Polish press sharply criticizes the treaty, calling for decisive action, and Polish deputies in the Reichstag take a strongly negative stance on the issue. These concerns begin to undermine German control over Poland and threaten the stability of the occupation."

At a meeting of officers, as a result of growing outrage against the treaty's arrangements, it was decided to go over to the Russian side. Haller's troops engaged in a battle with Austro-Hungarian units, attempting to break through to the east in order to reunite with other Polish formations in chaos-stricken Russia. Although some soldiers managed to break through, more than 5,000 were captured, disarmed and imprisoned in internment camps in northern Hungary, where they await trials for treason. The mutiny caused outrage among the Austro-Hungarian authorities, who see it as an act of treason, but in Galicia Haller's legionaries are considered martyrs to the Polish cause. The press details the harsh conditions in the internment camps, and Galician politicians press Vienna to obtain the soldiers' release."

 ### Economics Focus Tree & Everything ###

 POL_the_price_of_the_war: "The Price of Independence"
 POL_the_price_of_the_war_desc: "The entire country is in chaos and economic collapse. The partitioners have looted everything they could. Hunger and suffering are everywhere - on the streets of cities and in the shacks of villages, there is nowhere to work, as most of the industry has been completely destroyed, moved somewhere else, demolished or blown up. Many people died in fratricidal battles or were sent to distant lands. In the countryside, devastation is everywhere, there are shortages of food and lack of somewhere to live, and the stench of rotting dead livestock is unbearable. The lands "on the Vistula River" are now only the ruins of its once magnificent structure."

 POL_the_price_of_independence: "The Price of Independence"
 POL_the_price_of_independence_desc: "The [POL.GetName] and the Polish people have to pay a great price in return for their freedom and independence. This punishment is unimaginably gigantic destruction.\n\nThere is widespread hunger and suffering on city streets and in village shacks. Industry, mining, commerce and crafts have been completely destroyed, relocated or are in severe decline.\n\nThere is nothing to eat, nowhere to sleep, nowhere to work. Everything is in ruins. Many people have died in fratricidal battles or have been exiled to distant lands.\n\nAlthough the situation looks deplorably appalling, the Polish nation will rise like a phoenix from the ashes, in this case like an eagle."

Peace would be a great thing, and citizens would have access to all sorts of services, but the current situation does not allow us to do so. The entire nation, in order to survive, must create a great war machine, and through struggle, pain, and money, survive and weather the coming storm."
