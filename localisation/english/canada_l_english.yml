canada.1.t: "For Continued Prosperity"
canada.1.d: "The Laurier premiership has seen a large increase in the prosperity of Canada, with its population soaring and its economy beginning to modernize. Overseeing a policy of increased immigration, full integration of western territories into Canadas political system, and the expansion of railways to connect the vast country together, the liberal rule can hardly be called unsucessful. However, with the liberals having ruled Canada for nearly 20 years straight, there is a level of fatigue building up as voters seek a change in leadership. With the 1911 elections looking like the next party will have a slim majority at best, our policies leading up to the election will be crucial towards swinging the electorate one way or another."
canada.1.a: "Lets see what we can do!"
canada.2.t: "Increased Racial Tensions in British Columbia"
canada.2.d: "The rapid increase in immigration in the last few decades has led to many of the white Canadian with British decent to be suspicious of immigrants coming from places like Africa and India. Several local officals are blatanly encouraging discrimination, while those in the conservative party have been campaigning on lowering immigration as of late. With our policy of continuing to encourage this immigration, which has helped our economy in rural areas of the country, has led to increased racial tensions in British Columbia."
canada.2.a: "Why can't everyone just get along?"
canada.3.t: "Reciprocal Trade Treaty With Canada?"
canada.3.d: "Today, Canadas government sent an offer to the United States to begin drafting a treaty with Canada that would reduce trade bariers between the 2 countries. Should we accept?"
canada.3.a: "Couldn't hurt!"
canada.3.b: "Canada would benefit from this more then we would"
canada.4.t: "United States Begins Treaty Negotiations"
canada.4.d: "We have recieved word from Taft that America will present a treaty to the United States congress soon for its vote. It's expected to pass with relative ease, and thus we can expect the treaty to be signed soon."
canada.4.a: "Great!"
canada.5.t: "U.S House Speaker Suggests Annexation of Canada"
canada.5.d: "Today when debating the American-Canadian reciprocal trade treaty, what should have been a relatively uncontroversial and smooth process has errupted to a huge scandal. When arguing in favor of the treaty, Champ Clark, the speaker of America's house of represenatives gave a speech which amongst other things said "I look forward to the time when the American flag will fly over every square foot of British North America up to the North Pole." Even worse, this statement was met with a round of applause by most of the house. This has led to the conservatives rallying public support against the treaty, claiming letting this treaty pass would be the first step towards Canadas annexation into America. It seems their message has resonated with much of the Canadian public, which has led to a boost in conservative support."
canada.5.a: "Clarks words were taken out of context!"
canada.5.b: "This is outrageous, pull out of negotiations"
