 RAJ_morley_minto_reforms:0 "Morley-Minto Reforms Aftermath"
 RAJ_morley_minto_reforms_desc:0 "The Morley-Minto reforms, also knowed as the Indian Councils Act 1909, is an act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that brought a limited increase in the involvement of Indians in the governance of British India. Named after Viceroy Lord Minto and Secretary of State John Morley, the act introduce elections to legislative councils and admitted Indians to councils of the Secretary of State for India, the viceroy, and to the executive councils of Bombay and Madras states. Muslims were also granted separate electorates according to the demands of the Muslim League. Since these reforms, the Indian people have been expecting further reforms, but they have yet to come."

 RAJ_bloated_legal_apparatus_desc:0 "Throughout the years, the British Parliament enacted various Acts relating to the colonial government, resulting in a complex and cumbersome legal framework that has become increasingly fragmented and unwieldy.\n\n§RCompleting the ''Consolidate Indian Laws''' Focus will allow us unbloating the legal apparatus.§!"

 RAJ_deindustrialisation_dynamic:0 "De-Industrialisation"
 RAJ_deindustrialisation_dynamic_desc:0 "The economic de-industrialisation of India is the name of the reduction in industrial-based activities within the Indian economy. This reduction began with the British colonisation of India, the subcontinent's economy being managed by the §YBritish East Indian Company§! from 1757 to 1858, the year India was directly incorporated into the British Empire. Our rule is marked by protectionist policies which restrict the sale of Indian goods and services within Britain, while flooding Indian markets with low-cost British goods and services, including the introduction of machine-made goods, without tariffs or quotas. By the 19th century, the British Empire had replaced the Indian economy as the world's largest textile producer. While India's GDP in 1757 was about 30% of the world's total GDP (more than all of Europe combined), it is now rapidly reaching 2% of the world's total GDP."

 RAJ_indian_army_dynamic:0 "Indian Army"
 RAJ_indian_army_dynamic_desc:0 "§Y''The British Government has undertaken to protect the dominions of the Native princes from invasion and even from rebellion within ; its army is organized for the defence not merely of British India, but of all possessions under the suzerainty of the King-Emperor.'' - Imperial Gazetteer of India§!\n\nThe term 'Indian Army' was first used informally to describe the broader 'Presidency Armies' of the Bengal, Madras and Bombay Armies. The Indian Army, raised as an independent army by the Government of India in 1895, gradually absorbed the three long-established Presidency Armies, fully integrating them in 1903. The same year, Lord Kitchener was appointed Commander-in-Chief of India and began what became known as the Kitchener Reforms.\n\nThese reforms structured the modern Indian Army, completing the unification of the three former Presidency Armies as well as other forces, outlining the defence of the North-West Frontier against foreign aggression as the primary role of the army, and the maintenance of internal security as a secondary role, in support of the police. With the reforms ending in 1909, the Indian Army was organised along British lines, although it always lagged behind in terms of equipment. Now a reformed force, the Indian Army has yet to see the light of a battlefield.\n\n§RIt would take a major conflict to close the gap.§!"

 # Caste System
 RAJ_caste_system:0 "Caste System"
 RAJ_caste_system_desc:0 "The caste system is a socio-political stratification of Indian society, taking its roots in ancient India. It divides the Indian population into different castes, assigned at birth, in order to determine individuals' roles within society. Transformed by various ruling elites during medieval India, it developed especially in the aftermath of the collapse of the Mughal Empire and the establishment of the British Raj. Our administration furthered this development, making rigid caste organisation a central mechanism of our colonial hold on the subcontinent. Since 1860, we incorporated the Indian caste system into our system of governance, granting administrative jobs and senior appointments only to Christians and people belonging to certain castes. While supported by the higher castes and nobility, granting us certain privileges, it remains a source of social unrest within the Indian population."

 RAJ_gilbert_elliot:0 "Gilbert Elliot"
 RAJ_gilbert_elliot_desc:0 "Born into an aristocratic Scottish family on the 9th of July 1845, Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound inherited the title of Earl of Minto from his father in 1859. Educated at Eton College and Oxford University, he later pursued a career in politics, serving as Member of Parliament for Haddingtonshire and as Lord in Waiting to Queen Victoria. Serving as Governor-General of Canada from 1898 to 1904, he oversaw the early years of Canadian nationhood and navigated complex issues such as Franco-English relations. Lord Minto's most significant contribution came in his role as colonial administrator, when he was appointed Viceroy of India in 1905. He proved a competent leader on the subcontinent, introducing the §YMorley-Minto reforms§! in 1909 to reconcile nationalist aspirations for greater autonomy with British imperial interests. However, his tenure will shortly come to an end and the Raj will soon have a new Viceroy to lead the subcontinent in these increasingly unstable times."
 RAJ_charles_hardinge:0 "Charles Hardinge"
 RAJ_charles_hardinge_desc:0 "Born into the esteemed Hardinge family, with his grandfather having served as Governor-General of India, Lord Hardinge is well-versed in the complexities of colonial administration. Educated at prestigious institutions such as Cheam School, Harrow School, and Trinity College, Cambridge, Lord Hardinge's intellectual acumen is matched only by his diplomatic prowess. His career in the diplomatic service has been marked by rapid ascension, from his early postings as first secretary in Tehran and Saint Petersburg to his tenure as Ambassador to Russia and Permanent Under-Secretary at the Foreign Office. Despite his conservative inclinations, Lord Hardinge has demonstrated a keen ability to navigate the shifting political landscapes of Europe and beyond. His close collaboration with Liberal Foreign Secretary Sir Edward Grey speaks to his adaptability and statesmanship. Now, as he assumes the role of Viceroy of India, Lord Hardinge brings a steady hand and a firm commitment to upholding the interests of the British Empire in the subcontinent. With his background in diplomacy and his deep understanding of colonial affairs, Lord Hardinge is poised to lead India through the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead."
 RAJ_frederic_thesiger:0 "Frederic Thesiger"
 RAJ_frederic_thesiger_desc:0 "Born on 12 August 1868 in London, England, Chelmsford received his education at prestigious institutions, including Winchester College and Magdalen College, Oxford. With a Bachelor of Arts degree in law, earned with first-class honours in 1891, Chelmsford demonstrates a keen intellect and a commitment to excellence. A man of many talents, Chelmsford's professional journey has been marked by diverse experiences. From his service in the army volunteer force to his role as Governor of Queensland in Australia, Chelmsford has demonstrated leadership and dedication in various capacities. His tenure as Governor of Queensland was characterised by a principled stand on issues of governance, which earned him both praise and criticism. Undeterred by challenges, Chelmsford's commitment to upholding the integrity of government institutions remains steadfast. In his new role as Viceroy of India, Chelmsford brings a wealth of administrative experience and a reputation for fairness and diplomacy. His appointment comes at a critical juncture in India's history, with growing calls for self-governance and increased autonomy. As he assumes his duties, Chelmsford is well placed to navigate the complexities of Indian politics with tact and resolve, seeking to foster harmony and progress on the subcontinent."

 ww1_war_raj.1.d:0 "After years of campaigning for Indian rights in South Africa, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi has returned to India, his homeland. Arriving in Bombay to a warm and enthusiastic reception, Gandhi's return marks a significant moment in India's struggle for independence. Gandhi, who had spent two decades in South Africa, emerged as a prominent and charismatic leader, using his philosophy of non-violent resistance, or satyagraha, to combat racial discrimination and injustice. His efforts in South Africa not only inspired millions, but also set the stage for his future endeavours in India.\n\nGandhi's return is expected to reinvigorate the Indian independence movement as he brings his wealth of experience, leadership and dedication to the cause of freedom and justice. Although he isn't the current president of the INC, he is now wielding increasing influence within the Congress and has become its leader in all but name."

 ww1_war_raj.2.d:0 "In a momentous development for Hindu political and cultural unity, the Sarvadeshak Hindu Sabha (All-India Hindu Grand Assembly), was officially established at the Kumbh Mela in Haridwar this month. This umbrella organization is the culmination of a concerted effort by Hindu leaders to consolidate regional Hindu Sabhas into a singular, powerful entity. The initiative, sparked by the controversial partition of Bengal in 1905 and the subsequent formation of the All India Muslim League, sought to safeguard Hindu interests amisdt increasing communal tensions.

 ww1_war_raj.3.d:0 "The ''Tinkathia system'' is a system whereby tenant farmers are forced to grow indigo, which is used to make dye, on part of their land as a condition of their tenancy. While the German invention of a cheaper, artificial dye reduced the demand for indigo, the start of the war reignited it and made indigo profitable again. So many tenants were once again forced to grow it on part of their land - as required by their lease - which naturally caused much anger and resentment.\n\nWhen Gandhi returned from South Africa less than two years ago and saw the peasants in northern India being oppressed by the indigo planters, he tried to use the same methods he had used in South Africa to organise mass uprisings of people protesting against injustice. This led to the recent launch of the 'Satyagraha' campaign in the Champaran district of Bihar, with farmers demanding, among other things, the abolition of the Tinkathia system."

Receiving support from the Indian National Congress, notably Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi launched the Kheda Satyagraha, which organised the peasants of all the different ethnic and caste communities of Kheda to sign a petition calling for the tax for this year to be scrapped in wake of the famine. The government in Bombay rejected the charter, warning that if the peasants did not pay, the lands and property would be confiscated and many arrested, but the Satyagraha continued.\n\nAs was promised, the government's collectors and inspectors sent in thugs to seize property and cattle, while the police confiscated the lands and all agrarian property. The farmers did not resist arrest, nor retaliate, instead, they used their cash and valuables to donate to the Gujarat Sabha which was officially organising the protest. Gujaratis sympathetic to the revolt in other parts of India helped to shelter the relatives and property of the protesting peasants as well."

Alam had uncovered the underlying Bengali revolutionary network of the 'Anushilan Samiti' that linked the murders and other robberies, and was preparing to consolidate the charges to bring them all to trial in a single case.\n\nBy 29 January 1910, 47 of the accused had been arrested. The trial of the accused began on 4 March 1910, with a second hearing in the Calcutta High Court taking place today. However, the decentralised structure of the Samiti meant that the prosecution's attempts to show that the crimes were linked and that the Samiti was a unified organisation failed. 33 of the accused were subsequently acquitted.

Concessions were eventually granted to the peasants in 1904, but these only lasted until 1906, when Prithvi Singh ascended to the jagir, withdrew the concessions granted and instructed officials to levy increased taxes.\n\nUnable to get a hearing from the Jagirdar, some peasants decided to abandon their lands and migrate to neighbouring Gwalior and Bundi, while another 15,000 peasants recently launched a ''No Tax'' campaign, deciding to leave their lands uncultivated and instead cultivate the rented plots in neighbouring Bundi, Gwalior and Mewar states."

Over the next few days, his followers launched a series of attacks, particularly on the police outpost at Gadhran, the Parbatgadh fort in Sunth, and generally on local villages in both Sunth and Banswara. Police were sent to break up the meeting, but negotiations failed. The Indian princes then sought a military solution, units of the Imperial Service Troops and the Mewar Bhil Corps laid siege to the hill, and on 12 November Govindgiri and his deputy Punja Pargi sent a delegation to the British with a list of grievances, but no negotiations took place. However, the commanding officer gave the delegation an ultimatum, disband by 15 November. The Bhil stood their ground and stayed.

In 1865 he founded the London Indian Society to discuss Indian political, social and literary matters and in 1867 he helped to found the East India Association. This was the forerunner of the INC, whose main aim was to sensitise the British public to the situation in India, but the Association soon began to wield considerable influence on the British Parliament. He was also a member of the Indian National Association, a few years before the founding of the Indian National Congress, which had the same aims and would later merge. He continued his political career by becoming Dewan of Baroda in 1874 and a member of the Legislative Council of Bombay in 1885. Naoroji moved to Britain and continued his political involvement by running and being elected for the Liberal Party in the 1892 general election. Refusing to take the oath on the Bible, he was allowed to take the oath of office in the name of God on his copy of the Khordeh Avesta.\n\nNaoroji claimed many titles, being the first Indian to hold the academic position of Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy, the first British Indian Member of Parliament and twice elected President of the Indian National Congress.

 ww1_flavor_raj.32.d:0 "The Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College was founded in 1875 by Sir Syed Ahmad Khan and began functioning on 24 May 1875. The movement associated with Syed Ahmad Khan and the college came to be known as the Aligarh Movement, which pressed for the need to establish a modern education system for India's Muslim population. He saw proficiency in English and Western science as necessary skills for maintaining Muslim political influence. Khan's vision for the college was based on his visit to Oxford University and Cambridge University, and he wanted to establish an education system similar to the British model.\n\nIn the early 1900s, the Muslim University Association was formed to spearhead efforts to transform the college into a university. The Government of India informed the Association that a sum of thirty lakhs rupees should be raised to establish the university. A Muslim University Foundation Committee therefore began to raise the necessary funds, with contributions from both Muslims and non-Muslims. Today, with the passage of the Aligarh Muslim University Act, the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College became the Aligarh Muslim University."

The Central Sikh League, responding to the growing discontent among Sikhs, demanded that the management of the sacred shrine be transferred from government hands to an elected representative body accountable to the Sikh panth.\n\nThis bold action comes in the wake of the tragic Jallianwala Bagh massacre, which left an indelible mark on the Sikh community and fueled their determination for autonomy. The massacre, coupled with the controversial support of General Dyer by Arur Singh, the then head priest of the Golden Temple, ignited widespread outrage within Singh Sabha circles. This unrest, along with the broader disturbances across Punjab in 1919, amplified the call for Sikhs to reclaim control of their gurdwaras from corrupt and unrepresentative mahants."

Nevertheless, these efforts drew the attention of national leaders to the Bijolia movement and it succeeded in gaining their support. As a result, the Bijolia peasant movement continued to gain publicity and began to spread to other jagirs such as Begun, Parsoli and Bhinder. In December 1921, the Mewar State Resident reported:\n\n''The unrest is now spreading to Bhinder, an estate under the darbar management, where the cultivators are refusing the pay revenue. The situation in Bijolia and in the neighbouring thikanas of Parsoli, Begun and Basi has distinctly deteriorated. There is a general refusal to pay revenue. There is threat of violence if any attempt is made to collect revenue or to enforce official orders...An atmosphere of discontent is being created and the movement is spreading.''\n\nThis compelled the Governor General's agent to visit the various jagirs of Mewar and instruct the jagirdar and the state of Mewar to conclude an agreement with the farmers. Finally, the Bijolia Agreement was signed today, bringing with it many changes, including the reduction in amount of talwar bandhi, no taxes when there was no cultivation, reduction in chatoond tax and land revenue, etc."

Recently, the implementation of the Khilafat and Non-Cooperation movements in the region has merged with the economic hardship of the lower class Mappila people, the lowest hierarchical muslim ethnic group in Malabar, squeezed to the last shilling by the upper hierarchical Hindu ethnic group, the Jenmi.\n\nWhile there have been several accidents and clashes between the Mappilas and the police, today was the last straw. A police squad arrested a number of Khilafat volunteers and seized records from the Mambaram mosque in Tirurangadi, leading to rumours that the building had been desecrated. A large crowd of Mappilas gathered in Tirurangadi and besieged the local police station, prompting the police to open fire on the crowd.  Following this incident, the rebels attacked and seized other police stations, government treasuries, and entered courts and registry offices where they destroyed records, with some even climbing on judges' seats and proclaiming the advent of ''swaraj''."

To qualify their new leader, the rebels use British titles such as 'Assistant Inspector', 'Colonel', 'Collector', 'Governor', 'Viceroy' or even 'King'.\n\nDuring the proclamation, Variyankunnath stated his will to abolish the Jenmi system, setting up a military, creating its own passport, its own currency, and a separate system of taxation. He also used the proclamation of his new state to declare Ernad and Valluvanad as "Khilafat kingdoms".

Such conversions were done by the Government Party and Reserve Policemen in mufti mingling themselves with the rebels (masquerading as rebels.) Moreover, because some Hindu brethren, aiding the military, handed over to the military innocent (Moplahs) who were hiding themselves from the military, a few Hindus have been put to some trouble. Besides, the Nambudiri, who is the cause of this rising, has also similarly suffered. The Hindus are compulsorily impressed for military service. Therefore, several Hindus seek protection in my Hill. Several Moplahs, too, have sought my protection. Now the chief military commander [of the government] is causing Hindus to evacuate from these Taluks. Innocent women and children of Islam, who have done nothing and possess nothing, are not permitted to leave the place.

This pre-emptive strike, intended to curb the increasing assaults by Gurkha troops in the region, culminated in a fierce battle resulting in significant casualties.\n\nOn the early morning, a well-organized group of insurgents, meticulously trained for two days under Variyamkunnan, Chembrasseri Ibmichi Koya Thangal, and Mukri Ahamad, launched an unexpected assault on the Gurkha camp. The initial charge, bolstered by cries of "takbir," saw 400 men breach the camp's defenses. According to eyewitness accounts, the Gurkha forces, numbering between 150 to 300, were caught off-guard, with many soldiers killed in their sleep. Despite the surprise, the Gurkhas mounted a valiant defense, which still couldn't withstand the ferocity of the attack, leading to the death of their commander, Captain Averell.\n\nThe battle extended beyond the camp, with additional skirmishes resulting in the deaths of the Pandikkad postmaster and two government loyalists. Reports on casualties vary, with official British statements citing only four casualties among their ranks, while rebel sources claim that up to 120 Gurkhas were killed in the conflict.

Nevertheless, the enthusiasm of the crowd remained undiminished as they welcomed their monarchs with fervent cheers.\n\nThe crowning event of the royal visit, the Durbar, unfolded at Coronation Park. Here, amidst a gathering of dignitaries and local residents, the King-Emperor and Queen-Empress appeared resplendent in their Coronation robes. Bedecked in the Imperial Crown of India, adorned with a dazzling array of diamonds, sapphires, emeralds, and rubies, the royal couple received homage from native princes and dignitaries.
