canada.1.t: "For Continued Prosperity"
canada.1.d: "The Laurier premiership has seen a large increase in the prosperity of Canada, with its population soaring and its economy beginning to modernize. Overseeing a policy of increased immigration, full integration of western territories into Canadas political system, and the expansion of railways to connect the vast country together, the liberal rule can hardly be called unsucessful. However, with the liberals having ruled Canada for nearly 20 years straight, there is a level of fatigue building up as voters seek a change in leadership. With the 1911 elections looking like the next party will have a slim majority at best, our policies leading up to the election will be crucial towards swinging the electorate one way or another."
