BUL_vasil_radoslavov_desc:0 "Born in Lovech, §YRadoslavov§! pursued his studies in law at Heidelberg, where he developed a keen interest in §qGerman§! culture and ideals. Politically active since 1884, he was successively appointed to a number of roles, including Minister of Justice (Twice), Prime Minister, Minister of Finance, Minister of Internal Affairs (Twice) and Minister of National Enlightenment.\n\n§YRadoslavov§! holds the distinction of being the youngest person to have ever served as Prime Minister of Bulgaria at 32 years old. However, his tenure was marred by allegations of corruption, which ultimately led to his trial by the State Court on charges of high treason in 1903. Despite the eight-month imprisonment and debarment of civil and political rights that he received, he was granted amnesty by the Stambolovists."

ww1_bulgaria.69.t:0 "Turkish Opposition"
ww1_bulgaria.69.d:0 "The territories once held by the Ottoman Empire now stand under Bulgarian rule, yet the local Turkish population remains resistant. Tensions are rising, and it seems something must be done to address the opposition. Should we enforce harsher policies or attempt to offer autonomy to calm the region?"
ww1_bulgaria.69.a:0 "It's For Their Own Good!"
ww1_bulgaria.69.b:0 "Perhaps an Autonomous Thrace would be Beneficial?"

ww1_bulgaria.70.t:0 "Greek Opposition"
ww1_bulgaria.70.d:0 "The newly acquired territories that once belonged to Greece are proving troublesome. Greek nationals in these areas remain loyal to their homeland, refusing to fully integrate into Bulgaria. Their defiance might need to be quashed, or should we wait and hope their resistance will wane?"

ww1_bulgaria.71.b:0 "Leave it Alone"

ww1_bulgaria.72.t:0 "The Censorship Proves Mediocre"
ww1_bulgaria.72.d:0 "Despite the efforts to censor the incident, the story has spread in fragmented and distorted forms. The public remains somewhat aware, but their understanding is muddled by confusion and rumors."
ww1_bulgaria.72.a:0 "Stupid People with Their Thoughts"

ww1_bulgaria.73.t:0 "The Censorship Backfires"
ww1_bulgaria.73.d:0 "The censorship attempt has only made things worse. The public sees the government's heavy-handed approach as an admission of guilt or fear, and unrest has grown, with calls for greater transparency."
ww1_bulgaria.73.a:0 "Stupid People with Their Thoughts"

ww1_bulgaria.74.t:0 "The Censorship Works"
ww1_bulgaria.74.d:0 "The censorship has been effective. The story has been suppressed, and the public's attention has moved on to other matters. The government appears to have successfully defused the situation."
ww1_bulgaria.74.a:0 "Good"

ww1_BUL_TUR.1.d:0 "Since 1909 we've been negotiating with the new Tsardom of Bulgaria, we've had Mustafa Asim Bey and his assistant, Nabey Bey, representing us. We've already made multiple breakthroughs with Bulgaria. We've acknowledged their independence and Ferdinand's position of king. Their new prime minister, Ivan Geshov, would like to continue negotiations. It could be quite worthwhile but we can surely expect Bulgaria to ask for more concessions..."
ww1_BUL_TUR.1.a:0 "Yes"
ww1_BUL_TUR.1.b:0 "No"

ww1_BUL_TUR.2.t:0 "Concerns Raised by Mustafa Asim Bey: Conscription of Ottoman Citizens in Bulgaria"
ww1_BUL_TUR.2.d:0 "Mustafa Asim Bey claims that Ottoman citizens are being conscripted by the Bulgarian Tsardom to serve in the military, potentially against their own country. He suggests that we should cease such actions to ensure stability and safety for Ottoman citizens living in Bulgaria."
ww1_BUL_TUR.2.a:0 "He has a good point"

ww1_BUL_TUR.3.t:0 "Ottoman Agreement to Resume Negotiations"

ww1_BUL_TUR.6.d:0 "Due to Bulgaria's recent independence, only recognized by us in 1909, a 10s of thousands of Ottoman citizens still reside in Bulgaria, particularly in Eastern Rumelia. Unfortunately Bulgaria has been enforcing conscription on them as if they are citizens of the Tsar, and if they refuse they face fines and even possibly jail time!"
ww1_BUL_TUR.6.a:0 "This is unacceptable"

ww1_BUL_TUR.7.t:0 "Concerns About the Upcoming Mufti Elections"
ww1_BUL_TUR.7.d:0 "The Ottoman delegation is concerned that if Hocazade Mehmet Muhiddin Efendi is re-elected as the Bulgarian Mufti, Muslims in Bulgaria may lose their rights by the end of the decade. We'd much prefer if Suleyman Rusdi in office, for he'd treat the muslims and Ottoman citizens residing in Bulgaria much better."
ww1_BUL_TUR.7.a:0 "Express concerns about Mehmet Muhiddin Efendi"

ww1_BUL_TUR.8.t:0 "What Attitude Should Mustafa Asim Bey Adopt?"

ww1_BUL_TUR.8.c:0 "Strict"

ww1_BUL_TUR.9.t:0 "Mustafa Asim Bey Adopts a Sympathetic Attitude"
ww1_BUL_TUR.9.d:0 "Mustafa Asim Bey is displaying a sympathetic attitude during negotiations, appearing unusually willing to compromise. He even goes so far as to blame the problems on the Young Turks' government."
ww1_BUL_TUR.9.a:0 "Interesting"

ww1_BUL_TUR.10.t:0 "Border Conflicts"
ww1_BUL_TUR.10.d:0 "Border conflicts plague our nations. With the tense relations in all of Macedonia and Thrace there've been multiple cases of Ottoman and Bulgarian soliders exchanging shots. If this continues it could result in more deaths and more war. A war that would be very uncertain..."

ww1_BUL_TUR.14.d:0 "Mustafa Asim Bey raises concerns about the upcoming Mufti elections in Bulgaria. He fears that if Hocazade Mehmet Muhiddin Effendi wins re-election that the results for the Muslims and Ottoman citizens alike residing in Bulgaria will be quite unfavorable to the Sultan."
ww1_BUL_TUR.14.a:0 "We will take this into consideration"

Saafet chose to adopt a Slavic name, Ruska. The next day, her father, a hodzha, protested to the mayor along with other Muslims. They claimed their daughter had been abducted and was still underage (almost 16 years old) for marriage. On February 27, 1910, the court revoked the marriage permission and ordered Saafet to return to her parents. She went back to their house until the evening. That night, a crowd of “adventurers” gathered outside Saafet’s house intending to “rescue” her. The authorities moved her to a police station but couldn’t manage the approximately 1000 people, and Saafet eventually married Yordan on the 28th. Their wedding was celebrated by many in the central square, as it was the first Sunday before Lent, and a traditional fancy-dress carnival was held. The local police officer, who also attended the carnival, was mocked for failing to keep Saafet in the police station. Half an hour later, he called for cavalry support, and after some mutual verbal insults, a fight broke out between the citizens and the military. The clashes resulted in 24 deaths and about 70 injuries. Initially, the police tried to cover up the story by restricting communications to and from Ruse, but it soon became top news in newspapers across the country."
BUL_peasantry_desc:0 "In the rural heartlands of Bulgaria, it is the peasantry, more specifically the cystic ‘peasantry,’ which remains the mainstay of the nation through times of economic repugnance and political upheaval. Deeply rooted in culture and more inclination to its soil, these diligent people contribute to the national food production. It is true that there is backwardness in terms of infrastructure development and technology. However, it is this will power that is most likely going to be the building block for the future of Bulgaria."

Those the tensions between our two biggest patrons have largely cooled, our main political parties, otherwise mostly in agreement on their internal policy, are still split between East and West. If we wish to keep our cordial relations with the Great Powers, we must be very weary of our government's actions, lest we alienate either side."
